General Dog Care,ASPCA,"A dog can be a wonderful addition to any home, but whether you're an experienced pet parent or a first-time adopter, it's important to keep your canine companion's health and happiness a top priority. Below are some useful tips for all dog parents.","dog, headline",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/dog1.png?alt=media&token=c524e6c5-ef7d-4347-b4fc-66d002914da2
Dog's Nutrient,ASPCA,"• Puppies eight to 12 weeks old need four meals a day.%&07%• Feed puppies three to six months old three meals a day.%&07%• Feed puppies six months to one year two meals a day.%&07%• When your dog reaches his first birthday, one meal a day is usually enough.%&07%• For some dogs, including larger canines or those prone to bloat, it's better to feed two smaller meals.%&07%Premium-quality dry food provides a well-balanced diet for adult dogs and may be mixed with water, broth or canned food. Your dog may enjoy cottage cheese, cooked egg or fruits and vegetables, but these additions should not total more than ten percent of his daily food intake.%&07%Puppies should be fed a high-quality, brand-name puppy food (large breed puppy foods for large breeds). Please limit 'people food' however, because it can result in vitamin and mineral imbalances, bone and teeth problems and may cause very picky eating habits and obesity. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times, and be sure to wash food and water dishes frequently.","dog, nutrient, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-photos.appspot.com/o/dog%2F2.dog.png?alt=media&token=90a7b77f-c5ae-424a-a699-16e76257043a
Exercise for Dog,ASPCA,"Dogs need exercise to burn calories, stimulate their minds, and stay healthy. Individual exercise needs vary based on breed or breed mix, sex, age and level of health. Exercise also tends to help dogs avoid boredom, which can lead to destructive behaviors. Supervised fun and games will satisfy many of your pet's instinctual urges to dig, herd, chew, retrieve and chase.","dog, health, exercise, training",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-photos.appspot.com/o/dog%2F3.dog.png?alt=media&token=0264cec5-bf8e-4307-9cd6-1e27bb26b8b3
Grooming for Dog,ASPCA,"Help keep your dog clean and reduce shedding with frequent brushing. Check for fleas and ticks daily during warm weather. Most dogs don't need to be bathed more than a few times a year. Before bathing, comb or cut out all mats from the coat. Carefully rinse all soap out of the coat, or the dirt will stick to soap residue.

Handling a Dog,ASPCA,"To carry a puppy or small dog, place one hand under the dog's chest, with either your forearm or other hand supporting the hind legs and rump. Never attempt to lift or grab your puppy or small dog by the forelegs, tail or back of the neck. If you do have to lift a large dog, lift from the underside, supporting his chest with one arm and his rear end with the other.","dog, handling, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/dog5.png?alt=media&token=70051664-554f-4b3d-b035-e5c84214a66b
Housing for dog,ASPCA,"Your pet needs a warm, quiet place to rest, away from all drafts and off the floor. A training crate or dog bed is ideal, with a clean blanket or pillow placed inside. Wash the dog's bedding often. If your dog will be spending a lot of time outdoors, be sure she has access to shade and plenty of cool water in hot weather, and a warm, dry, covered shelter when it's cold.","dog, general, shelter",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/dog6.png?alt=media&token=eee330fd-5284-433e-985e-a5f549be7d92
Dog's Licensing and Identification,ASPCA,"Follow your community’s licensing regulations. Be sure to attach the license to your dog’s collar. This, along with an ID tag and implanted microchip or tattoo, can help secure your dog’s return should she become lost.","dog, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/dog7.png?alt=media&token=364f9204-e099-4197-9615-ffccd69ff0a4
Dog's Health,ASPCA,"Fleas and Ticks%&07%Daily inspections of your dog for fleas and ticks during the warm seasons are important. Use a flea comb to find and remove fleas. There are several new methods of flea and tick control. Speak to your veterinarian about these and other options.%&07%Medicines and Poisons%&07%Never give your dog medication that has not been prescribed by a veterinarian. If you suspect that your animal has ingested a poisonous substance, call your veterinarian or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center for 24-hour animal poison information at (888) 426- 4435.%&07%Spaying and Neutering%&07%Female dogs should be spayed, and male dogs neutered by six months of age.%&07%Vaccinations%&07%Understanding Vaccines%&07%Vaccines help prepare the body's immune system to fight the invasion of disease-causing organisms. Vaccines contain antigens, which look like the disease-causing organism to the immune system but don't actually cause disease. When the vaccine is introduced to the body, the immune system is mildly stimulated. If a pet is ever exposed to the real disease, his immune system is now prepared to recognize and fight it off entirely or reduce the severity of the illness.%&07%Core Vaccines%&07%Core vaccines are considered vital to all pets based on risk of exposure, severity of disease or transmissibility to humans.%&07%Vaccines for canine parvovirus, distemper, canine hepatitis and rabies are considered core vaccines. Non-core vaccines are given depending on the dog’s exposure risk. These include vaccines against Bordetella bronchiseptica, Borrelia burgdorferi and Leptospira bacteria.%&07%Determining the Timing and Frequency of Vaccinations%&07%Your veterinarian can best determine a vaccination schedule for your pet. This will depend on the type of vaccine, your pet’s age, medical history, environment and lifestyle.%&07%For puppies: If his mother has a healthy immune system, a puppy will most likely receive antibodies in mother’s milk while nursing. Puppies should receive a series of vaccinations starting at six to eight weeks of age. A veterinarian should administer a minimum of three vaccinations at three- to four-week intervals. The final dose should be administered at 16 weeks of age.%&07%For adult dogs: Some adult dogs might receive certain vaccines annually, while other vaccines might be given every three years or longer.%&07%Risks Associated with Vaccination%&07%Immunizations should mildly stimulate the animal’s immune system in order to create protection from specific infectious diseases. This stimulation can create mild symptoms, ranging from soreness at the injection site to fever and allergic reactions.%&07%The Scoop on Poop%&07%Keep your dog on a leash when you are outside, unless you are in a secure, fenced-in area. If your dog defecates on a neighbor's lawn, the sidewalk, or any other public place, please clean it up.","dog, general, health, vaccination, littering",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/dog8.png?alt=media&token=8c927138-231e-4490-adcd-b84e396e2130

Aggression,ASPCA,"Aggression is the most common and most serious behavior problem in dogs. It’s also the number-one reason why pet parents seek professional help from behaviorists, trainers and veterinarians.%&07%What Is Aggression?%&07%The term “aggression” refers to a wide variety of behaviors that occur for a multitude of reasons in various circumstances. Virtually all wild animals are aggressive when guarding their territories, defending their offspring and protecting themselves. Species that live in groups, including people and dogs, also use aggression and the threat of aggression to keep the peace and to negotiate social interactions.%&07%To say that a dog is “aggressive” can mean a whole host of things. Aggression encompasses a range of behaviors that usually begins with warnings and can culminate in an attack. Dogs may abort their efforts at any point during an aggressive encounter. A dog that shows aggression to people usually exhibits some part of the following sequence of increasingly intense behaviors:%&07%• Becoming very still and rigid%&07%• Guttural bark that sounds threatening%&07%• Lunging forward or charging at the person with no contact%&07%• Mouthing, as though to move or control the person, without applying significant pressure%&07%• “Muzzle punch” (the dog literally punches the person with her nose)%&07%• Growl%&07%• Showing teeth%&07%• Snarl (a combination of growling and showing teeth)%&07%• Snap%&07%• Quick nip that leaves no mark%&07%• Quick bite that tears the skin%&07%• Bite with enough pressure to cause a bruise%&07%• Bite that causes puncture wounds%&07%• Repeated bites in rapid succession%&07%• Bite and shake%&07%Dogs don’t always follow this sequence, and they often do several of the behaviors above simultaneously. Many times, pet parents don’t recognize the warning signs before a bite, so they perceive their dogs as suddenly flying off the handle. However, that’s rarely the case. It can be just milliseconds between a warning and a bite, but dogs rarely bite without giving some type of warning beforehand.%&07%Classification of Aggressive Behavior%&07%If your dog has been aggressive in the past or you suspect she could become aggressive, take time to evaluate the situations that have upset her. Who bore the brunt of her aggression? When and where did it happen? What else was going on at the time? What had just happened or was about to happen to your dog? What seemed to stop her aggression? Learning the answers to these questions can clarify the circumstances that trigger your dog’s aggressive reaction and provide insight into the reasons for her behavior. You need an accurate diagnosis before you can hope to help your dog.%&07%Aggressive behavior problems in dogs can be classified in different ways. A beneficial scheme for understanding why your dog is aggressive is based on the function or purpose of the aggression. If you think of aggression this way, you can determine what motivates your dog to behave aggressively and identify what she hopes to gain from her behavior.%&07%Territorial Aggression%&07%Some dogs will attack and bite an intruder, whether the intruder is friend or foe.%&07%Dogs’ wild relatives are territorial. They live in certain area, and they defend this area from intruders. Wolves are highly territorial. If a coyote or a wolf who’s not part of a pack invades their territory, the resident wolves will attack and drive off the intruder. Some dogs display the same tendencies. They bark and charge at people or other animals encroaching on their home turf. Dogs are often valued for this level of territorial behavior. However, some dogs will attack and bite an intruder, whether the intruder is friend or foe. Territorial aggression can occur along the boundary regularly patrolled by a dog or at the boundaries of her pet parents’ property. Other dogs show territorial aggression only toward people or other animals coming into the home. Male and female dogs are equally prone to territorial aggression. Puppies are rarely territorial. Territorial behavior usually appears as puppies mature into adolescence or adulthood, at one to three years of age.%&07%Protective Aggression%&07%Dogs may show aggressive behavior when they think that one of their family members or friends is in peril.%&07%Dogs are a social species. If they were left on their own, they would live together in small groups, or packs, of family and friends. If one member of a pack is in danger, the others typically rush in to help defend that individual. This is classified as protective aggression because the dogs are protecting one of their own. Pet dogs may show the same type of aggressive behavior when they think that one of their family members or friends (human or animal) is in peril. Sometimes dogs reserve protective aggression for individuals they consider particularly vulnerable. A dog who has never shown aggression to strangers in the past might start behaving aggressively when she has a litter of puppies. Likewise, a dog might first show protective aggression when her pet parents bring a human child into the family. While this behavior sounds appealing at first glance, problems arise when the protective dog starts to treat everyone outside the family, including friends and relatives, as threats to the baby’s safety. Both male and female dogs are equally prone to protective aggression. Puppies are rarely protective. Like territorial behavior, protective aggression usually appears as puppies mature into adolescence or adulthood, at one to three years of age.%&07%Possessive Aggression%&07%Many dogs show the tendency to guard their possessions from others, whether they need to or not.%&07%Dogs evolved from wild ancestors who had to compete for food, nesting sites and mates to survive. Even though our pet dogs no longer face such harsh realities, many still show the tendency to guard their possessions from others, whether they need to or not. Some dogs only care about their food. These dogs might react aggressively when a person or another animal comes near their food bowl or approaches them while they’re eating. Other dogs guard their chew bones, their toys or things they’ve stolen. Still others guard their favorite resting spots, their crates or their beds (Often, these dogs also guard their pet parents’ beds!). Less common are dogs who guard water bowls. Usually a possessive dog is easy to identify because she’s only aggressive when she has something she covets. But some dogs will hide their cherished things around the house and guard them from unsuspecting people or animals who have no idea that they’re anywhere near a valued object. Male and female dogs are equally prone to possessive aggression, and this type of aggression is common in both puppies and adults. For more detailed information about food-related possessive aggression and how to treat it, please see our article, Food Guarding.%&07%Fear Aggression%&07%A fearful dog may become aggressive if cornered or trapped.%&07%When animals and people are afraid of something, they prefer to get away from that thing. This is called the flight response. But if escaping isn’t an option, most animals will switch to a fight response. They try to defend themselves from the scary thing. So a dog can be afraid of a person or another animal but still attack if she thinks this is her only recourse. A fearful dog will normally adopt fearful postures and retreat, but she may become aggressive if cornered or trapped. Some dogs will cower at the prospect of physical punishment but attack when a threatening personapproaches. Fear aggression can occur when a dog is exposed to a fearful or traumatic event or when she lacks proper socialization and confidence. Fear aggression can be directed towards people, other animals, or specific situations. It is important to note that fear aggression is rooted in fear and anxiety, and punishing or forcing the dog will only exacerbate the problem. Fear aggression can occur in dogs of any age or sex, and early intervention is crucial to prevent the behavior from worsening.%&07%Defensive Aggression%&07%Defensive aggression occurs when a dog perceives a threat and responds with aggression to protect herself.%&07%Defensive aggression is similar to fear aggression but is more specific to situations where a dog feels the need to defend herself. It can be triggered by perceived threats such as unfamiliar people or animals approaching too quickly or invading the dog's personal space. Defensive aggression is a reactive behavior intended to ward off potential harm. Dogs exhibiting defensive aggression may display warning signs such as growling, showing teeth, and snapping to create distance and prevent further escalation. Defensive aggression can occur in dogs of all ages and both sexes, and proper socialization and positive experiences can help prevent or manage this behavior.%&07%Social Aggression%&07%Some dogs show aggression towards other dogs or animals when it comes to resources, territory, or social hierarchy.%&07%Social aggression in dogs refers to aggressive behavior displayed towards other dogs or animals in social interactions. It can occur in various contexts such as resource guarding (food, toys, attention), competition for territory or mates, or establishing social hierarchy within a group. Social aggression can be seen in both male and female dogs and can range from mild displays of dominance to more intense fights. Proper socialization and training from an early age can help minimize social aggression in dogs.%&07%Frustration-Elicited Aggression%&07%Frustration can lead to aggressive behavior in dogs when they are unable to obtain or accomplish what they desire.%&07%Frustration-elicited aggression occurs when a dog becomes frustrated because she is unable to obtain or accomplish something she desires. This frustration can stem from barriers preventing access to desired objects, lack of opportunity for physical exercise or mental stimulation, or thwarted social interactions. Frustration can escalate into aggression if the dog has not learned alternative coping mechanisms or if the frustration is consistently reinforced. It's important to provide appropriate outlets for a dog's energy, mental stimulation, and teach alternative behaviors to prevent frustration-elicited aggression.%&07%Redirected Aggression%&07%Redirected aggression occurs when a dog redirects her aggression onto a different target, often due to frustration or arousal.%&07%Redirected aggression happens when a dog is aroused or frustrated by a particular stimulus but is unable to direct her aggression towards it. As a result, the dog redirects her aggression onto another target that may be nearby, such as another dog or a person. This behavior is not specifically targeted at the redirected target but is a result of the dog's heightened emotional state. Proper management and avoidance of situations that trigger the aggression can help prevent redirected aggression.%&07%Pain-Elicited Aggression%&07%Dogs in pain may exhibit aggression as a defensive response to protect themselves from further discomfort.%&07%Pain-elicited aggression occurs when a dog is in pain or discomfort and exhibits aggressive behavior as a defensive response. When a dog is in pain, she may perceive touch, handling, or certain movements as a threat to her well-being, causing her to respond aggressively to protect herself. It's essential to address any underlying medical conditions and ensure the dog receives appropriate pain management to alleviate pain-induced aggression.%&07%Sex-Related Aggression%&07%Sex-related aggression can occur due to hormonal influences and is often seen in intact male dogs.%&07%Sex-related aggression is primarily seen in intact (not neutered) male dogs and can be influenced by hormonal factors. This type of aggression is typically directed towards other male dogs and is often related to competition for mates or territory. Neutering can help reduce the incidence of sex-related aggression in male dogs.%&07%Predatory Aggression%&07%Some dogs may exhibit predatory aggression towards smaller animals or objects that trigger their prey drive.%&07%Predatory aggression is seen in some dogs when their natural prey drive is triggered by smaller animals or objects that resemble prey. Dogs with predatory aggression may exhibit stalking, chasing, and grabbing behaviors. It is important to prevent dogs with predatory aggression from having access to potential prey animals and to provide alternative outlets for their predatory instincts, such as interactive toys or games.%&07%Can Aggression be Cured?%&07%While it is possible to reduce or manage aggressive behavior in dogs through behavior modification techniques, it's important to note that complete elimination of aggression cannot be guaranteed. Aggression is a complex behavior influenced by various factors, including genetics, early experiences, socialization, and individual temperament. The goal of treatment is to minimize the occurrence and intensity of aggressive episodes, ensure the safety of all individuals involved, and improve the dog's overall quality of life. It is recommended to work with a qualified professional, such as a certified animal behaviorist or a positive reinforcement-based trainer, who can assess the dog's specific situation and design a customized behavior modification plan. Additionally, ruling out any underlying medical conditions or pain-related issues is crucial, and consulting with a veterinarian is highly recommended.%&07%Remember that each dog is unique, and the treatment approach should be tailored to the individual dog's needs. Ongoing management, supervision, and implementing safety precautions are essential to prevent aggressive incidents and ensure the well-being of everyone involved. It is important not to generalize aggression based on breed but to consider each dog's temperament, history, and specific circumstances to develop an appropriate treatment plan.","dog, aggression, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/dog14.png?alt=media&token=9c99810c-b542-4f67-a16b-d5a2d489204f
Barking,ASPCA,"Barking is one of many forms of vocal communication for dogs. People are often pleased that their dog barks, because it alerts them to the approach of people to their home or it tells them there’s something that the dog wants or needs. However, sometimes a dog’s barking can be excessive. Because barking serves a variety of functions, you must identify its cause and your dog’s motivation for barking before you can treat a barking problem.%&07%Each type of barking serves a distinct function for a dog, and if he’s repeatedly rewarded for his barking—in other words, if it gets him what he wants—he can learn to use barking to his benefit. For example, dogs who successfully bark for attention often go on to bark for other things, like food, play and walks. For this reason, it’s important to train your dog to be quiet on cue so that you can stop his attention-related barking and teach him to do another behavior instead—like sit or down—to get what he wants.%&07%Many owners can identify why their dog is barking just by hearing the specific bark. For instance, a dog’s bark sounds different when he wants to play as compared to when he wants to come in from the yard. If you want to reduce your dog’s barking, it’s crucial to determine why he’s barking. It will take some time to teach your dog to bark less. Unfortunately, it’s just not realistic to expect a quick fix or to expect that your dog will stop barking altogether. (Would you expect a person to suddenly stop talking altogether?) Your goal should be to decrease, rather than eliminate, the amount of barking. Bear in mind that some dogs are more prone to barking than others. In addition, some breeds are known as “barkers,” and it can be harder to decrease barking in individuals of these breeds.%&07%Why Dogs Bark%&07%Territorial Barking%&07%Dogs can bark excessively in response to people, dogs or other animals within or approaching their territories. Your dog's territory includes the area surrounding his home and, eventually, anywhere he has explored or associates strongly with you: your car, the route you take during walks and other places where he spends a lot of time.%&07%Alarm Barking%&07%If your dog barks at any and every noise and sight regardless of the context, he’s probably alarm barking. Dogs engaged in alarm barking usually have stiffer body language than dogs barking to greet, and they often move or pounce forward an inch or two with each bark. Alarm barking is different than territorial barking in that a dog might alarm bark at sights or sounds in any location at all, not just when he’s defending familiar areas, such as your house, yard or car.%&07%Attention-Seeking Barking%&07%Some dogs bark at people or other animals to gain attention or rewards, like food, toys or play.%&07%Greeting Barking%&07%Your dog might be barking in greeting if he barks when he sees people or other dogs and his body is relaxed, he’s excited and his tail is wagging. Dogs who bark when greeting people or other animals might also whine.%&07%Compulsive Barking%&07%Some dogs bark excessively in a repetitive way, like a broken record. These dogs often move repetitively as well. For example, a dog who’s compulsively barking might run back and forth along the fence in his yard or pace in his home.%&07%Socially Facilitated Barking%&07%Some dogs barks excessively only when they hear other dogs barking. This kind of barking occurs in the social context of hearing other dogs, even at a distance—such as dogs in the neighborhood.%&07%Frustration-Induced Barking%&07%Some dogs bark excessively only when they’re placed in a frustrating situation, like when they can’t access playmates or when they’re confined or tied up so that their movement is restricted.%&07%Other Problems That Can Cause Barking%&07%Illness or Injury%&07%Dogs sometimes bark in response to pain or a painful condition. Before attempting to resolve your dog’s barking problem, please have your dog examined by a veterinarian to rule out medical causes.%&07%Separation-Anxiety Barking%&07%Excessive barking due to separation anxiety occurs only when a dog’s caretaker is gone or when the dog is left alone. You’ll usually see at least one other separation anxiety symptom as well, like pacing, destruction, elimination, depression or other signs of distress. For more information about this problem, please see our article, Separation Anxiety.%&07%What to Do About Your Dog’s Excessive Barking%&07%The first step toward reducing your dog’s barking is to determine the type of bark your dog is expressing. The following questions can help you to accurately decide on which type of barking your dog is doing so that you can best address your dog’s problem. Think about your answers to these questions as you read through the information below on the different types of barking and their treatments.%&07%1. When and where does the barking occur?%&07%2. Who or what is the target of the barking?%&07%3. What things (objects, sounds, animals or people) trigger the barking?%&07%4. Why is your dog barking?%&07%If It’s Territorial Barking or Alarm Barking%&07%Territorial behavior is often motivated by both fear and anticipation of a perceived threat. Because defending territory is such a high priority to them, many dogs are highly motivated to bark when they detect the approach of unknown people or animals near familiar places, like their homes and yards. This high level of motivation means that when barking territorially, your dog might ignore unpleasant or punishing responses from you, such as scolding or yelling. Even if the barking itself is suppressed by punishment, your dog’s motivation to guard his territory will remain strong, and he might attempt to control his territory in another way, such as biting without warning.%&07%Dogs engage in territorial barking to alert others to the presence of visitors or to scare off intruders or both. A dog might bark when he sees or hears people coming to the door, the mail carrier delivering the mail and the maintenance person reading the gas meter. He might also react to the sights and sounds of people and dogs passing by your house or apartment. Some dogs get especially riled up when they’re in the car and see people or dogs pass by. You should be able to judge from your dog’s body posture and behavior whether he’s barking to say “Welcome, come on in!” or “Hey, you’d better hit the road. You’re not welcome at my place!” If you’re dealing with a dog in the first category, follow the treatment outlined in this article for greeting barking (below). If you’re dealing with a dog in the latter category who isn’t friendly to people, you’ll be more successful if you limit your dog’s ability to see or hear passersby and teach him to associate the presence of strangers with good things, such as food and attention. %&07%For treatment of territorial barking, your dog’s motivation should be reduced as well as his opportunities to defend his territory. To manage your dog’s behavior, you’ll need to block his ability to see people and animals. Removable plastic film or spray-based glass coatings can help to obscure your dog’s view of areas that he observes andguards from within your house. Use secure, opaque fencing to surround outside areas your dog has access to. Don’t allow your dog to greet people at the front door, at your front yard gate or at your property boundary line. Instead, train him to go to an alternate location, like a crate or a mat, and remain quiet until he’s invited to greet appropriately.%&07%Alarm barking is very similar to territorial barking in that it’s triggered by sights and sounds. However, dogs who alarm bark might do so in response to things that startle or upset them when they’re not on familiar turf. For example, a dog who barks territorially in response to the sight of strangers approaching will usually only do so when in his own home, yard or car. By contrast, a dog who habitually alarm barks might vocalize when he sees or hears strangers approaching in other places, too. Although territorial barking and alarm barking are a little different, the recommendations below apply to both problems.%&07%“Quiet” Training%&07%If your dog continues to alarm bark or bark territorially, despite your efforts to block his exposure to sights and sounds that might trigger his barking, try the following techniques:%&07%• Teach your dog that when someone comes to the door or passes by your property, he’s permitted to bark until you say “Quiet.” Allow your dog to bark three to four times. Then say “Quiet.” Avoid shouting. Just say the command clearly and calmly. Then go to your dog, gently hold his muzzle closed with your hand and repeat “Quiet.” Release your dog’s muzzle, step away, and call him away from the door or window. Then ask your dog to sit and give him a treat. If he stays beside you and remains quiet, continue to give him frequent treats for the next few minutes, until whatever triggered his barking is gone. If your dog resumes barking right away, repeat the sequence above. Do the same outside if he barks at passersby when he’s in the yard.%&07%• If you prefer not to hold your dog’s muzzle or if doing so seems to scare your dog or make him struggle, you can try a different method. When your dog barks, approach him, calmly say “Quiet,” and then prompt his silence by feeding him a steady stream of tiny, pea-sized treats, such as chicken, hot dogs or bits of cheese. After enough repetitions of this sequence, over several days or more of training, your dog will begin to understand what “Quiet” means. You’ll know that he’s catching on if he consistently stops barking as soon as he hears you say “Quiet.” At this point, you can gradually extend the time between the cue, “Quiet,” and your dog’s reward. For example, say “Quiet,” wait 2 seconds, and then feed your dog several small treats in a row. Over many repetitions, gradually increase the time from 2 seconds to 5, then 10, then 20, and so on.%&07%• If the “Quiet” procedure is ineffective after 10 to 20 attempts, then allow your dog to bark 3 to 4 times, calmly say “Quiet,” and then immediately make a startling noise by shaking a set of keys or an empty soda can filled with pennies. If your dog is effectively startled by the sound, he’ll stop barking. The instant he does, call him away from the door or window, ask him to sit, and give him a treat. If he stays beside you and remains quiet, continue to give him frequent treats for the next few minutes until whatever triggered his barking is gone. If he resumes barking right away, repeat the sequence. If this procedure doesn’t work after 10 to 20 attempts, please Find Professional Behavior Help.%&07%• If your dog barks at people or other dogs during walks, distract him with special treats, like chicken, cheese or hot dogs, before he begins to bark. (Soft, very tasty treats work best.) Show your dog the treats by holding them in front of his nose, and encourage him to nibble at them while he’s walking past a person or dog who would normally cause him to bark. Some dogs do best if you ask them to sit as people or dogs pass. Other dogs prefer to keep moving. Make sure you praise and reward your dog with treats anytime he chooses not to bark.%&07%• It may help to have your dog wear a head halter at times when he’s likely to bark (for example, on walks or in your house). A halter can have a distracting or calming effect and make your dog less likely to bark. Make sure you reward him for not barking. (Important note: For safety reasons, only let your dog wear the halter when you can supervise him.)%&07%• If your dog most often barks territorially in your yard, keep him in the house during the day and supervise him when he’s in the yard so that he can’t just bark his head off when no one’s around. If he’s sometimes able to engage in excessive alarm barking (when you’renot home, for example), that behavior will be reinforced when it goes unpunished. Use management techniques to prevent your dog from being able to practice the behavior. For example, close your curtains so that your dog can't see people passing by your house, or confine your dog to a back room when the mail carrier or other visitors are expected.%&07%If It's Attention-Seeking Barking%&07%Attention-seeking barking can be a nuisance, but it's relatively easy to address. Here's what you can do:%&07%• When your dog barks to get attention, ignore him. Turn your back, cross your arms and don't make eye contact. Don't yell at him or push him away. Just completely ignore him. When he stops barking, wait for a moment of silence, and then reward him with praise and a treat. Gradually increase the duration of the silence required for a reward, so that your dog learns that staying quiet brings the best results.%&07%• Teach your dog an alternative behavior, like sitting or lying down, to earn attention and rewards. Practice this behavior regularly and reinforce it with praise, treats or playtime. This way, your dog will learn that being quiet and calm is more effective in getting what he wants.%&07%If It's Greeting Barking%&07%Greeting barking can be managed and modified using the following techniques:%&07%• Teach your dog an alternative behavior, like sitting, when people approach. Practice this behavior with friends or family members who are willing to help. Ask them to approach your house or yard, and when your dog starts to bark, instruct him to sit and reward him for staying quiet and calm. Over time, your dog will associate the arrival of people with the cue to sit rather than barking.%&07%• Use a leash when taking your dog for walks and maintain control of his behavior. If he starts to bark at people or other dogs, interrupt him with a gentle tug on the leash, redirect his attention to you, and reward him for being calm. Consistency and repetition are key in training your dog to be quiet and well-behaved on walks.%&07%If It's Compulsive Barking%&07%Compulsive barking can be challenging to address, and it's recommended to seek professional help from a qualified dog behaviorist or trainer. They can assess your dog's behavior and provide tailored strategies to manage and modify compulsive barking.%&07%If It's Socially Facilitated Barking%&07%Socially facilitated barking can be managed by addressing your dog's excitement and arousal levels when he hears other dogs barking. Here are some tips:%&07%• Practice obedience exercises and focus training with your dog in the presence of other dogs barking. Teach him to respond to your commands and to redirect his attention to you. Reward calm and attentive behavior with treats or playtime.%&07%• Gradually expose your dog to controlled situations where he can hear other dogs barking from a distance. Start with a distance that doesn't trigger excessive barking and reward your dog for staying calm and quiet. Gradually decrease the distance over time, always reinforcing calm behavior.%&07%If It's Frustration-Induced Barking%&07%Frustration-induced barking can be addressed by minimizing your dog's frustration and providing appropriate outlets for his energy. Here's what you can do:%&07%• Ensure that your dog gets plenty of physical exercise and mental stimulation. Regular walks, interactive toys, and training sessions can help reduce frustration and channel his energy.%&07%• Avoid placing your dog in situations that trigger frustration, such as prolonged confinement or being tied up. Instead, create a calm and enriching environment where he can engage in appropriate behaviors.%&07%If Other Problems Are Causing Barking%&07%If you suspect that illness, injury, separation anxiety, or other underlying issues are causing your dog's excessive barking, it's essential to consult with a veterinarian. They can conduct a thorough examination, diagnose any potential health problems, and recommend appropriate treatment options.%&07%Remember, addressing excessive barking requires patience, consistency, and positive reinforcement. Training techniques may vary depending on your dog's temperament and specific barking triggers. If you're having difficulties or if your dog's barking persists despite your efforts, consider seeking assistance from a professional dog trainer or behaviorist who can provide personalized guidance.","dog, barking, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/dog15.png?alt=media&token=9c22e86b-dd44-482d-82a0-050a32c865e9
Destructive Chewing,ASPCA,"It’s normal for puppies and dogs to chew on objects as they explore the world. Chewing accomplishes a number of things for a dog. For young dogs, it’s a way to relieve pain that might be caused by incoming teeth. For older dogs, it’s nature’s way of keeping jaws strong and teeth clean. Chewing also combats boredom and can relieve mild anxiety or frustration.%&07%Rule Out Problems That Can Cause Destructive Chewing%&07%Separation Anxiety%&07%Dogs who chew to relieve the stress of separation anxiety usually only chew when left alone or chew most intensely when left alone. They also display other signs of separation anxiety, such as whining, barking, pacing, restlessness, urination and defecation. To learn more about separation anxiety and how to treat it, please see our article, Separation Anxiety.%&07%Fabric Sucking%&07%Some dogs lick, suck and chew at fabrics. Some experts believe that this behavior results from having been weaned too early (before seven or eight weeks of age). If a dog’s fabric-sucking behavior occurs for lengthy periods of time and it’s difficult to distract him when he attempts to engage in it, it’s possible that the behavior has become compulsive. If you think this might be the case with your dog, please Find Professional Behavior Help.%&07%Hunger%&07%A dog on a calorie-restricted diet might chew and destroy objects in an attempt to find additional sources of nutrition. Dogs usually direct this kind of chewing toward objects related to food or that smell like food.%&07%How to Manage or Reduce Your Dog’s Destructive Chewing%&07%Puppy Teething%&07%The desire to investigate interesting objects and the discomfort of teething motivate puppies to chew. Much like human infants, puppies go through a stage when they lose their baby teeth and experience pain as their adult teeth come in. This intensified chewing phase usually ends by six months of age. Some recommend giving puppies ice cubes, special dog toys that can be frozen or frozen wet washcloths to chew, which might help numb teething pain. Although puppies do need to chew on things, gentle guidance can teach your puppy to restrict chewing to appropriate objects, like his own toys.%&07%Normal Chewing Behavior%&07%Chewing is a perfectly normal behavior for dogs of all ages. Both wild and domestic dogs spend hours chewing bones. This activity keeps their jaws strong and their teeth clean. Dogs love to chew on bones, sticks and just about anything else available. They chew for fun, they chew for stimulation, and they chew to relieve anxiety. While chewing behavior is normal, dogs sometimes direct their chewing behavior toward inappropriate items. Both puppies and adult dogs should have a variety of appropriate and attractive chew toys. However, just providing the right things to chew isn’t enough to prevent inappropriate chewing. Dogs need to learn what is okay to chew and what is not. They need to be taught in a gentle, humane manner.%&07%Useful Tips%&07%• “Dog-proof” your house. Put valuable objects away until you’re confident that your dog’s chewing behavior is restricted to appropriate items. Keep shoes and clothing in a closed closet, dirty laundry in a hamper and books on shelves. Make it easy for your dog to succeed.%&07%• Provide your dog with plenty of his own toys and inedible chew bones. Pay attention to the types of toys that keep him chewing for long periods of time and continue to offer those. It’s ideal to introduce something new or rotate your dog’s chew toys every couple of days so that he doesn’t get bored with the same old toys. (Use caution: Only give your dog natural bones that are sold specifically for chewing. Do not give him cooked bones, like leftover t-bones or chicken wings, as these can splinter and seriously injure your dog. Also keep in mind that some intense chewers may be able to chip small pieces off of natural bones or chip their own teeth while chewing. If you have concerns about what’s safe to give your dog, speak with his veterinarian.)%&07%• Offer your dog some edible things to chew, like bully sticks, pig ears, rawhide bones, pig skin rolls or other natural chews. Dogs can sometimes choke on edible chews, especially if they bite off and swallow large hunks. If your dog is inclined to do this, make sure he’s separated from other dogs when he chews so he can relax. (If he has to chew in the presence of other dogs, he might feel that he has to compete with them and try to quickly gulp down edible items.) Also be sure to keep an eye on your dog whenever he’s working on an edible chew so that you can intervene if he starts to choke.%&07%• Identify times of the day when your dog is most likely to chew and give him a puzzle toy filled with something delicious. You can include some of your dog’s daily ration of food in the toy.%&07%• Discourage chewing inappropriate items by spraying them with chewing deterrents. When you first use a deterrent, apply a small amount to a piece of tissue or cotton wool. Gently place it directly in your dog’s mouth. Allow him to taste it and then spit it out. If your dog finds the taste unpleasant, he might shake his head, drool or retch. He won’t pick up the piece of tissue or wool again. Ideally, he will have learned the connection between the taste and the odor of the deterrent, and he’ll be more likely to avoid chewing items that smell like it. Spray the deterrent on all objects that you don’t want your dog to chew. Reapply the deterrent every day for two to four weeks. Please realize, however, that successful treatment for destructive chewing will require more than just the use of deterrents. Dogs need to learn what they can chew as well as what they can’t chew.%&07%• Do your best to supervise your dog during all waking hours until you feel confident that his chewing behavior is under control. If you see him licking or chewing an item he shouldn’t, say “Uh-oh,” remove the item from your dog’s mouth, and insert something that he CAN chew. Then praise him happily. If you suspect that your dog might react aggressively if you remove an item from his mouth, please Find Professional Behavior Help.%&07%• When you can’t supervise your dog, you must find a way to prevent him from chewing on inappropriate things in your absence. For example, if you work during the day, you can leave your dog at home in a confinement area for up to six hours. Use a crate or put your dog in a small room with the door or a baby gate closed. Be sure to remove all things that your dog shouldn’t chew from his confinement area, and give him a variety of appropriate toys and chew things to enjoy instead. Keep in mind that if you confine your dog, you’ll need to give him plenty of exercise and quality time with you when he’s not confined.%&07%• Provide your dog with plenty of physical exercise (playtime with you and with other dogs) and mental stimulation (training, social visits, etc.). If you have to leave your dog alone for more than a short period of time, make sure he gets out for a good play session beforehand.%&07%• To help your dog learn the difference between things he should and shouldn’t chew, it’s important to avoid confusing him by offering unwanted household items, like old shoes and discarded cushions. It isnisn’t fair to expect your dog to learn that some shoes are okay to chew and others aren’t.%&07%Some puppies and juvenile dogs like to chew dirty underwear. This problem is most easily resolved by always putting dirty underwear in a closed hamper. Likewise, some puppies and dogs like to raid the garbage and chew up discarded sanitary napkins and tampons. This can be very dangerous. If a dog eats a sanitary item, it can expand while moving through his digestive system. Discard napkins and tampons in a container that’s inaccessible to your dog. Most young dogs grow out of these behaviors as they mature.%&07%Lack of Exercise or Mental Stimulation%&07%Some dogs simply do not get enough physical and mental stimulation. Bored dogs tend look for ways to entertain themselves, and chewing is one option. To prevent destructive chewing, be sure to provide plenty of ways for your dog to exercise his mind and body. Great ways to accomplish this include daily walks and outings, off-leash play with other dogs, tug and fetch games, clicker training classes, dog sports (agility, freestyle, flyball, etc.), and feeding meals in food puzzle toys.%&07%Stress and Frustration%&07%Sometimes a dog will chew when experiencing something that causes stress, such as being crated near another animal he doesn’t get along with or getting teased by children when confined in a car. To reduce this kind of chewing, try to avoid exposing your dog to situations that make him nervous or upset.%&07%Dogs who are prevented from engaging in exciting activities sometimes direct biting, shaking, tearing, and chewing at nearby objects. Shelter dogs and puppies sometimes grab and shake blankets or bowls in their kennels whenever people walk by because they’d like attention. When they don’t get it, their frustration is expressed through destructive behavior. A dog who sees a squirrel or cat run by and wants to chase but is behind a fence might grab and chew at the gate. A dog watching another dog in a training class might become so excited by the sight of his canine classmate having fun that he grabs and chews his leash. (Agility and Flyball dogs are especially prone to this behavior because they watch other dogs racing around and having a great time, and they want to join in the action.) The best intervention for this problem is to anticipate when frustration might happen and give your dog an appropriate toy for shaking and tearing. In a class situation, carry a tug or stuffed toy for your dog to hold and chew. If your dog is frustrated by animals or objects on the other side of a fence or gate at home, tie a rope toy to something sturdy by the gate or barrier. Provide shelter dogs and puppies with toys and chew bones in their kennels. Whenever possible, teach them to approach the front of their kennels and sit quietly to solicit attention from passersby.%&07%What NOT to Do%&07%• Do not show your dog the damage he did and spank, scold or punish him after the fact. He cannot connect your punishment with some behavior he did hours or even minutes ago.%&07%• Do not use duct tape to hold your dog’s mouth closed around a chewed object for any length of time. This is inhumane, will teach your dog nothing, and dogs have died from this procedure.%&07%• Do not tie a damaged object to your dog. This is inhumane and will teach your dog nothing.%&07%• Do not leave your dog in a crate for lengthy periods of time (more than six hours) to prevent chewing.%&07%• Do not muzzle your dog to prevent chewing.","dog, destructive, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/dog16.png?alt=media&token=fbaf81b9-2baf-4119-990f-2b9e69340fb0
Food Guarding,ASPCA,"Guarding possessions from humans or other animals is normal behavior for dogs. Wild animals who successfully protect their valuable resources—such as food, mates and living areas—are more likely to survive in the wild than those who don’t. However, we find the tendency to guard valued items undesirable in our domestic pets, especially when the behavior is directed toward people.%&07%Resource guarding in dogs can range from relatively benign behavior, like running away with a coveted item or growling at an approaching person, to full-blown aggression, such as biting or chasing a person away. Some dogs only direct resource guarding toward certain people, often strangers. Other dogs guard their resources from all people. Dogs vary in what they consider valuable. Some dogs only guard chew bones or toys. Some guard stolen items, such as food wrappers from the trash can or socks. Many dogs guard food.%&07%In many cases, food guarding doesn’t need to be treated. Plenty of pet parents with food-guarding dogs simply take reasonable precautions to ensure everyone’s safety. They leave their dogs alone while they’re eating, or they might even feed their dogs in a separate room, in a crate or behind a barrier. They provide their dogs with adequate amounts of food so that their dogs feel less motivated to guard. They never attempt to take away stolen or scavenged food from their dogs.%&07%However, if children live in a home with a resource-guarding dog, the situation becomes unacceptably risky. Children are more likely to get bitten because they’re less able to recognize a dog’s warning signals and more likely to behave recklessly around the dog. In some cases, the risk of living with a dog who guards resources is too high for adults, too. For example, some dogs guard food on tables and counters, leftover food on dishes in the dishwasher and food dropped on the floor. Because it’s impossible to avoid these situations, it’s impossible to prevent the guarding behavior.%&07%An Ounce of Prevention%&07%Young puppies are prone to guarding behavior because they often have to compete with their littermates for limited amounts of food. Breeders often feed puppies from one large communal pan, and the puppy who manages to eat the most will grow the quickest and become the strongest. If a breeder is not observant, this situation can deteriorate into one or two puppies monopolizing most of the food. A history of being rewarded for aggressive behavior can become firmly established in these puppies.%&07%If you have a new puppy or adult dog who doesn’t guard things, it’s important to do some simple exercises to prevent the development of guarding behavior. As soon as you bring your new dog home, make sure you hand feed several meals. Sit with your dog and give him his kibble one bite at a time. During hand-fed meals, speak pleasantly to your dog and stroke him while you offer him food with your other hand. If he shows any discomfort or wariness, stop hand feeding him and see the exercises outlined below. If your dog seems calm and comfortable with hand feeding, switch to holding his bowl in your lap and allowing him to eat from the bowl. Continue to speak to him and stroke his head and body while he eats. After a few meals, place your dog’s bowl on the floor and, as he eats his regular chow, periodically reach down to drop in a piece of something especially tasty, like a small bite of cheese, chicken or beef. If you do this intermittently for the first few months after you bring your dog home, he should remain relaxed and unthreatened by your presence while he eats.%&07%Some Precautions%&07%If you think your dog is likely to bite you, please do not attempt to resolve his resource guarding on your own. Doing so could place you in serious harm, especially if your dog has a history of biting or has attempted to bite in the past. Consult with a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB or ACAAB) or a board-certified veterinary behaviorist (Dip ACVB). If you can’t find a behaviorist, you can seek help from a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT), but be sure that the trainer is qualified to help you. Determine whether she or he has education and experience in treating aggression, since this expertise is not required for CPDT certification. Please see our article, Finding Professional Behavior Help, to locate one of these experts in your area.%&07%With some dogs, treatment for food guarding can be tricky. If you attempt the exercises below and your dog appears stressed and refuses to eat—but he still guards his bowl—discontinue the exercises immediately and seek help from a behaviorist or qualified trainer. You’ll also want to seek help from one of these professionals if you’re able to do the exercises below for a while but hit a point at which your dog does not progress further.%&07%Treatment Exercises for Food Guarding%&07%The treatments used for food guarding are desensitization combined with counterconditioning. They’re highly effective but fairly complex and detailed.%&07%The exercises described below are done in stages. After doing the exercises in one stage, you can progress to the next stage if your dog is relaxed and shows no signs of aggression. Dog body language can be complex, so it’s sometimes difficult to tell how a dog feels at any given moment. To determine what your dog looks like when he’s relaxed, take note of what his body, ears, eyes and tail do when you know he’s in a situation he finds pleasant. For example, notice what your dog looks like when you and he are relaxing together on the couch or taking a leisurely walk. Signs that a dog feels calm and content include a relaxed posture (muscles relaxed, not tensed), normal breathing or slight panting, eating at a normal pace, wagging and wiggling. Signs of aggression to watch for while you’re doing exercises include standing stiffly over the bowl, gulping the food, tensing or freezing, growling, staring, snapping, snarling, biting or chasing people away. If you see any of these signs, stop immediately and contact a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist, a board-certified veterinary behaviorist, or a qualified Certified Professional Dog Trainer.%&07%If you’re unsure about your dog’s reaction to the exercises, tether him to something sturdy. That way, if your dog moves toward you, he will be restrained by the leash.%&07%Before you start any of the exercises below, cut a number of special treats into bite-sized pieces for your dog. You’ll need to use something your dog absolutely loves and doesn’t get to eat at other times, like small bits of chicken, beef, hot dogs or cheese. The idea is to convince your dog that it’s wonderful when you approach him while he’s eating because you might bring him something much better than what he’s got in his bowl.%&07%Stage One%&07%•\tStand a few feet away from your dog while he eats dry kibble from a bowl on the floor. Do not move toward your dog.%&07%•\tSay something like, “What have you got there?” in a conversational tone and, at the same time, toss a special treat toward the bowl. Continue to do this every few seconds until your dog finishes eating his kibble.%&07%•\tRepeat this exercise each time you feed your dog until he eats in a relaxed way for 10 meals in a row. Thenyou can move on to Stage Two.%&07%Stage Two%&07%•\tWhile your dog eats dry kibble from a bowl on the floor, say “What have you got there?” in a conversational tone. At the same time, take one step toward him and toss a special treat toward the bowl. Then immediately step back. Repeat this sequence every few seconds until your dog has finished eating.%&07%•\tEach day, take one step closer to your dog before tossing him the special treat. Continue at this stage until you come within two feet of the bowl. When your dog eats in a relaxed way for 10 meals in a row as you repeatedly approach and stand two feet away and give him a treat, you’re ready to move to the next stage.%&07%Stage Three%&07%•\tWhile your dog eats dry kibble from a bowl on the floor, approach him saying “What have you got there?” in a conversational tone. Stand next to your dog’s bowl and drop a special treat into it. Then immediately turn around and walk away.%&07%•\tRepeat this sequence every few seconds until your dog has finished eating. When he eats in a relaxed way for 10 meals in a row, you’re ready for the next stage.%&07%Stage Four%&07%•\tWhile your dog eats dry kibble from a bowl on the floor, approach him saying “What have you got there?” in a conversational tone. Stand next to your dog, holding a special treat in your hand. Bend down slightly, holding the treat out just an inch or two in your dog’s direction. Encourage him to stop eating the food in the bowl to take the treat. After he eats the treat from your hand, immediately turn around and walk away. Repeat this sequence every few seconds until your dog has finished eating.%&07%•\tEach day, bend down a little more when you offer your dog the special treat so that your hand moves an inch or two closer to his bowl. Stay at this stage until you can bend down and hold your hand with the treat right next to your dog’s bowl. When your dog eats relaxed for 10 meals in a row as you repeatedly approach to bend down and offer him a treat next to his bowl, you’re ready for the next stage.%&07%Stage Five%&07%•\tWhile your dog eats dry kibble from a bowl on the floor, approach him saying “What have you got there?” in a conversational tone. Stand next to your dog, bend down and touch his bowl with one hand while offering him a special treat with your other hand.%&07%•\tContinue to do this every few seconds until your dog has finished eating. When your dog eats relaxed for 10 meals in a row, you can move to the next stage.%&07%Stage Six%&07%•\tWhile your dog eats dry kibble from a bowl on the floor, approach him saying “What have you got there?” in a conversational tone. Stand next to your dog, bend and pick up his bowl with one hand. Raise it only six inches off the floor and drop a special treat in the bowl. Then immediately return the bowl to the floor so that your dog can eat from it.%&07%•\tContinue to do this every few seconds until your dog has finished all the food in his bowl. As you repeat the sequence, raise the bowl slightly higher off the floor each time until you can lift it all the way up to your waist and stand upright.%&07%•\tRepeat the sequence, but when you pick up your dog’s bowl, walk over to a table or counter with it. Then put a special treat into the bowl, walk back to your dog and return the bowl to the same place on the floor.%&07%Stage Seven: Making It Work for Everyone%&07%•\tThe last stage is to have all adult family members go through stages one through six. Each person needs to start at the beginning and progress through the steps the same way, always making sure that your dog continues to look relaxed and comfortable during exercises. Don’t assume that because your dog is okay with one person approaching his bowl, he’ll automatically be comfortable with another person doing the same thing. He has to learn that the rules work the same way with everyone.%&07%•\tThe entire treatment program above is gradual enough to help your dog relax and anticipate the special treats rather than feel threatened and become aggressive when people approach him while he’s eating. Through the exercises, your dog will learn that people approaching his food bowl bring even tastier food—they’re not coming to take his food away from him.%&07%Treatment Troubleshooting and Tips%&07%•\tIf you can’t feed your dog kibble for some reason, just make sure that the treats you offer by hand during exercises are more desirable to your dog than the food in his bowl.%&07%•\tIf you can feed your dog kibble but prefer he eat something else instead—such as a raw diet, homemade food or canned food—do all the exercises with kibble first but then go through the steps again using the more exciting food in your dog’s bowl. Again, just make sure what you offer by hand during exercises is still better than what your dog already has in his bowl.%&07%•\tIf your dog eats so quickly that you have few opportunities to offer better food during treatment exercises, buy a commercially available dish designed to slow down his eating. %&07%Managing Your Dog’s Behavior%&07%Apart from your treatment sessions, you need to manage your dog’s behavior carefully to avoid aggressive encounters. Do not allow others to go near your dog while he’s eating. If he guards food from children in the family, DO NOT attempt these exercises with any child under 18 years of age. Instead, seek help from a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB or ACAAB), a board-certified veterinary behaviorist (Dip ACVB), or a Certified Professional Dog Trainers (CPDT) with education and experience treating aggression.%&07%If your dog guards food from visitors to your home, it might be easier to manage his behavior than resolve it. If your dog and guests are in the same room, just remove all food items from the area. Alternatively, you can keep your dog confined in a separate area of your home while guests visit. Be aware that dogs sometimes guard food intended for people, even if the food is situated on a table or countertop. If food is going to be present when guests visit, you’ll want to confine your dog to ensure everyone’s safety.%&07%What NOT to Do%&07%•\tDo not punish or intimidate your dog when he guards food. Remember that when a person approaches a food-guarding dog, the dog will react as though the person intends to take the food away. This makes sense because dogs naturally compete for food. Some people insist that “dominating” your dog and showing that you’re stronger and able to take away his food will make him stop guarding it. On the contrary, doing so is dangerous and unnecessary. It can sometimes cause resource guarding to get worse, and it can damage your relationship with your dog. It’s easier and safer to simply change the way your dog feels about people approaching him when he has food through desensitization and counterconditioning.","dog, food guarding, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/dog17.png?alt=media&token=22da1e89-ee67-4127-9ac5-31ecb2224f9e
Howling,ASPCA,"Howling is one of many forms of vocal communication used by dogs. Dogs howl to attract attention, to make contact with others and to announce their presence. Some dogs also howl in response to high-pitched sounds, such as emergency vehicle sirens or musical instruments. Read on to learn what to do if your dog howls excessively.%&07%Problems to Rule Out First%&07%Separation Anxiety Howling%&07%If your neighbors call you and tell you that your dog is howling when you are at work, your dog’s excessive howling might be caused by separation anxiety. Separation anxiety howling only occurs when a dog is left alone or otherwise separated from his owner. This kind of howling is usually accompanied by at least one other symptom of separation anxiety, such as pacing, destruction, elimination, depression or other signs of distress. For more information about this problem, please see our article, Separation Anxiety.%&07%Medical Causes%&07%Dogs sometimes howl when they’re hurt or sick. If your dog starts howling or howls more than usual, take him to a veterinarian to rule out illness and injury before doing anything else.%&07%What to Do About Excessive Howling%&07%Howling in Responds to Sounds%&07%If your dog howls in response to some kind of trigger, like another dog howling or a nearby siren, he’ll probably stop when the sound stops. This type of howling usually isn’t excessive—unless, of course, the triggers occur frequently. If they do, you can use desensitization and counterconditioning (DSCC) to help your dog learn to be quiet.%&07%Systematic Desensitization and Counterconditioning%&07%When the problem is rooted in how a dog feels about a particular thing, it sometimes isn’t enough to just teach him a different behavior—like to fetch a toy instead of howling, for example. Instead, it’s most effective to change his motivation and feelings, which are the underlying reasons for the behavior problem in the first place.%&07%Systematic desensitization and counterconditioning are two common treatments for fears, anxiety, phobias and aggression—basically any behavior problem that involves arousal or emotions. It’s often most effective to use these two procedures together when trying to resolve animal behavior problems. If you think that a systematic desensitization and counterconditioning plan might help your dog, please see our article, Finding Professional Behavior Help, for information about locating a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB) or a board-certified veterinary behaviorist (Dip ACVB) in your area. If you can’t find a behaviorist near you, you can choose to hire a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT) instead. However, be sure to find out whether he or she has professional education and extensive experience using desensitization and counterconditioning. This kind of expertise isn’t required for CPDT certification, so it’s important to make sure that the CPDT you employ is qualified to help you.%&07%If Your Dog Howls, Whines or Barks to Get Your Attention%&07%Some dogs learn that howling can get them attention from people. If your dog howls for this reason, his howling will usually occur in your presence when he wants attention, food or desired objects. If your dog howls to get your attention or “ask” you for things he wants, like food or toys, you need to teach him two things to be successful in curbing his behavior. First of all, he needs to learn that howling doesn’t work (even if it did in the past). He also needs to learn that being quiet will work. If your dog realizes that howling always makes him invisible to you and being quiet earns him your attention as well as all the great stuff he wants in life, he’ll quickly learn to curb his vocal behavior.%&07%Ignore your dog’s attention-seeking howling%&07%•\tTo avoid accidentally rewarding your dog when he howls, totally ignore him as soon as he starts making noise. Don’t look at him, touch him or speak to him. Don’t try to scold him either. Dogs, like kids, often find any attention rewarding—even if it’s negative attention. So scolding your dog might make his howling behavior worse! Just pretend your dog is invisible. If you find it difficult to do this, try folding your arms across your chest and turning away from him completely.%&07%Reward your dog for being quiet%&07%•\tIt’s easy to forget to pay attention to your dog when he’s being quiet. Often, we only pay attention to our dogs when they’re doing something wrong! If you want your dog to learn to stop howling for attention, you’ll need to reward quiet behavior. Randomly give your dog treats and attention when he isn’t making noise. You should also make and stick to a new rule: Your dog doesn’t get anything he wants (food, toys, access to the outdoors, treats, petting, etc.) until he’s been quiet for at least five seconds. If your dog howls in an attempt to get your attention, ignore him until he’s quiet, as described above. Then, after five seconds of silence, you can pay attention to him again.%&07%You can also try teaching your dog to be quiet when you ask him to. First, say “Speak!” and try to get your dog to bark or howl. (Knocking on a wall or door usually works well.) Praise your dog when he starts making noise—but DO NOT give him a treat or toy. Then say “Hush” or “Quiet.” The moment your dog stops barking or howling for a second or two, quickly say “Good!” and give him a tasty treat. Repeat this sequence over and over, slowly stretching out the time that your dog must be quiet before earning his goodie. At first, one second of silence can earn him a treat. After he’s successfully mastered that step, increase the time to three seconds. If he’s successful again, increase the time to five seconds, then ten seconds, then 20 seconds, and so on.%&07%Spend Time with Your Dog%&07%Some dogs howl because they’re lonely, especially if they’re left alone or kept outside for many hours at a time. Dogs, like humans, are very social animals and need regular interaction with their human families. If your dog howls often when by himself, you may need to spend more quality time together. Bring him inside more often, play games and take walks with him. Take him to a fun training class that focuses on rewarding good behavior. When you must leave your dog home alone for more than a few minutes, be sure to give him plenty of toys and attractive chew items to enjoy by himself","dog, howling, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/dog18.png?alt=media&token=32214c42-9dba-4d9a-8174-7c01d3ff470e
Mounting and Masturbation,ASPCA,"Mounting, thrusting (humping) and masturbation are normal behaviors exhibited by most dogs. Dogs masturbate in various ways. They mount and thrust against other animals, people and objects, such as wadded-up blankets, dog beds and toys. Sometimes, dogs just rub against people or objects (without mounting them), or they lick themselves.%&07%Puppies often mount and hump their littermates, other playmates, people and toys. Some experts believe that this behavior functions as practice for future sexual encounters. As puppies reach sexual maturity, they start to mount other dogs in sexual contexts. After they’re neutered or spayed, many male and female dogs continue to mount and even masturbate because they have learned that the behavior feels good.%&07%Intact (not neutered) males will often masturbate if prevented from approaching a female in heat. Often, during courtship, females in heat mount and hump their male “suitors.” Female dogs also commonly mount and hump other females when one or both are in heat.%&07%Why Does Your Dog Do It?%&07%Sexual Behavior%&07%Masturbation is part of normal sexual behavior for both altered (spayed or neutered) and intact dogs. Both male and female dogs mount other dogs, people and objects. Most people don’t realize that this behavior isn’t limited to intact male dogs, nor do they know that neutered males can display erections and ejaculate just like intact males. Sexually motivated mounting and masturbation are often accompanied by “flirtatious” body language and courtship behavior (tail up, ears rotated backward, licking, pawing, play bows, etc.).%&07%Play Behavior%&07%Sexual behaviors, including mounting and thrusting, are part of normal play behavior. Dogs don’t usually display erections or ejaculate in the context of play. Some poorly socialized or undersocialized dogs excessively mount other dogs in response to play solicitation. They don’t seem to know how to play well and get overaroused during play.%&07%Response to Stress or Excitement%&07%Some dogs respond to stressful or exciting situations by mounting or masturbating. For instance, after meeting a new dog or person, an aroused and excited dog may mount another dog, his owner or a nearby object, like a dog bed or a toy.%&07%Compulsive Disorders%&07%Masturbating can become a compulsive habit, especially if a dog does it in response to stress. Compulsions like mounting and masturbating can interfere with a dog’s normal functioning.%&07%Social Behavior%&07%Dogs sometimes mount other animals and people to display social status or control. A dog mounting for this reason may or may not display an erection, but he’s unlikely to ejaculate.%&07%Medical Problems to Rule Out%&07%Various medical problems, including urinary tract infections, urinary incontinence, priapism (persistent, often painful erections) and skin allergies, can influence a dog’s mounting behavior. These issues can be serious if not properly treated and require medical attention rather than behavioral treatment. Dogs suffering from one of these or other medical issues often spend a lot of time licking and chewing the genital area. If you notice your dog excessively mounting, licking or chewing himself, or rubbing his body against things, take him to a veterinarian to rule out medical concerns.%&07%What to Do About Excessive Mounting and Masturbation%&07%If you think your dog may become aggressive if you stop him from mounting other dogs, people or objects, do not attempt to do so. Instead, consult a qualified professional, such as a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB or Associate CAAB) or a board-certified veterinary behaviorist (Dip ACVB). If you can’t find a behaviorist in your area, you can seek help from a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT), but be sure to determine whether she or he has professional training and extensive experience successfully treating aggression. This type of expertise isn’t required for CPDT certification. Please read our article, Finding Professional Behavior Help, for information about finding one of these experts in your area.%&07%Mounting During Play, in Response to Stress or for Sexual Reasons%&07%• If your dog mounts infrequently (once or twice a day at most) and it isn’t bothersome to you, other people or other dogs, it’s not necessary to stop his behavior.%&07%• If your dog’s mounting or masturbation does bother you, other people or other dogs, try to distract your dog. If you can, get his attention before he starts mounting or masturbating. Some dogs display amorous-looking behavior before mounting, so if your dog sidles up to something or someone and starts to pant, lick, whine, paw or rub against the person, dog or object, he may soon start to mount or hump. If you see your dog performing any of the behaviors above, or if you see him start to mount someone or something, toss a toy, play a game, give your dog a chewie, or ask him to perform some previously learned basic obedience skills or tricks that he enjoys (sit, down, shake, etc.).%&07%• If you have an intact male dog, consider neutering him. Although neutering doesn’t always stop a dog from mounting or masturbating, it does reduce his sexual motivation—especially if the behavior is triggered by the presence of a female dog who’s in heat. Likewise, if you have an intact female dog, consider spaying her. It might reduce her motivation to hump other dogs, especially if she only mounts when she’s in heat or when she’s around other female dogs in heat. Spaying or neutering your dog has other benefits, too. It prevents the birth of unwanted puppies, and it helps prevent serious medical problems like mammary and testicular cancers.%&07%• Be warned: If your dog mounts other dogs, he may get himself into trouble. Many dogs don’t like to be humped. They might take offense and start a fight with your “amorous” dog. If you have a hump-happy dog, you might want to teach him to leave other dogs alone when you ask him to. Once you’ve taught your dog what “leave it” means, you can start using it during his interaction with other dogs. Watch your dog carefully when he plays with his pals. As soon as you see him preparing to mount another dog tell him to “Leave it.” Remember to reward him if he does. If he doesn’t, end his play session and work on leave it without other dogs present for a while longer. If your dog habitually humps other dogs, you can also try teaching him to play games with you so that he’s less interested in other dogs. Tug and fetch are great!%&07%• If your dog has developed a habit of mounting you or other people, discourage him from humping by pushing him off, turning away, sitting down or somehow adopting a position that prevents him from mounting. If your dog won’t stop, say “Nope!” and immediately take him to a quiet, safe room for a short time-out. (Make sure that there aren’t any fun toys for him to play with in the time-out area.) Leave your dog alone for one to three minutes. When the time-out is over, let your dog out and behave as if nothing happened. There’s no need to act like you’re angry. If your dog tries to mount again,repeat the sequence above and give your dog another time-out. If you have to give your dog a time-out more than a couple of times, you may start to have trouble catching your dog when you say ""Nope!"" If that's the case, it will help to clip a lightweight two- to four-foot leash onto your dog's collar and let him drag it around at home when you're there to supervise him. Then you can pick up the leash when you need to take your dog to his time-out area. Be sure to remove the leash when you can't supervise your dog so that it doesn't accidentally get caught on furniture or get wrapped around your dog's legs.%&07%Discouragement by itself won't prevent mounting from reoccurring. You must also do some preventative training. You'll need to teach your dog a behavior that he can perform instead of mounting when he's around people—something that he can't do while humping. Train him to sit on cue, for example. After your dog readily sits for a treat when you ask him to, you can start using that skill to discourage humping. As soon as you see your dog start to mount, say ""Sit."" If he sits, praise him happily and reward him with a tasty treat. Then you can ask him to sit a few more times or perform other tricks he already knows. When your dog has performed some polite behaviors and calmed down a little, you can offer him a few minutes of play with a favorite toy. This may alter your dog's motivational state so that he's no longer interested in humping. If the humping occurs in specific contexts, such as in response to exciting or chaotic interactions between people (hugging, greeting, arguing, etc.), ask your dog to sit and stay whenever you do the things that trigger his mounting behavior. Remember to reward your dog frequently if he behaves politely instead of mounting.%&07%If your dog only mounts when dealing with stressful situations (greeting new people, for example), avoid those situations whenever possible. If you can't avoid a situation or thing that makes your dog anxious, try to reduce his stress as much as you can. For instance, if your dog finds visiting the veterinary clinic stressful, take him to the clinic for frequent social visits. During these trips to the vet's office, give your dog plenty of tasty treats and make sure that nothing unpleasant happens. After a few weeks or months of occasional ""cookie trips"" to the vet's office, your dog will start to enjoy going there. That change in his feelings will make future visits to the veterinary clinic much less stressful for him. If your dog becomes anxious when he greets new people, distract him when he encounters strangers so that the experience is less overwhelming for him. Try teaching your dog to sit for delicious goodies or fetch his favorite toy when new people visit your home.%&07%Licking%&07%• If your dog licks to stimulate himself infrequently (once or twice a day at most) and it isn't bothersome to you, it's not necessary to stop his behavior.%&07%• If your dog's licking behavior does bother you or causes irritation to his skin, try to distract him, preferably as soon as he starts to lick himself. Toss a toy, play a game, give your dog a chewie, or ask him to perform some previously learned basic obedience skills or tricks that he enjoys (sit, down, shake, etc.). You can also try moving your dog to a different location.%&07%Compulsive Mounting or Masturbation%&07%• As soon as your dog starts to mount or masturbate, try to distract him. Toss a toy, play a game, give your dog a chewie, or ask him to perform some previously learned basic obedience skills or tricks that he enjoys (for example, sit, down, and paw).%&07%• If your dog's behavior has become compulsive and interferes with his normal daily life, you may need to get help from a qualified professional.","dog, mounting, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/dog19.png?alt=media&token=60293719-e740-4e33-9492-efd0c99e0fbe
"Mouthing, Nipping and Biting in Puppies",ASPCA,"Puppies spend a great deal of time playing, chewing and investigating objects. All of these normal activities involve puppies using their mouths and their needle-sharp teeth. When puppies play with people, they often bite, chew and mouth on people’s hands, limbs and clothing. This kind of behavior may seem cute when your puppy is seven weeks old, but it’s not nearly so endearing when he’s three or four months old—and getting bigger by the day!%&07%What to Do About Puppy Mouthing%&07%It’s important to help your puppy learn to curb his mouthy behavior. There are various ways, some better than others, to teach this lesson. The ultimate goal is to train your puppy to stop mouthing and biting people altogether. However, the first and most important objective is to teach him that people have very sensitive skin, so he must be very gentle when using his mouth.%&07%Bite Inhibition: Teach Your Puppy to Be Gentle%&07%Bite inhibition refers to a dog’s ability to control the force of his mouthing. A puppy or dog who hasn’t learned bite inhibition with people doesn’t recognize the sensitivity of human skin, and so he bites too hard, even in play. Some behaviorists and trainers believe that a dog who has learned to use his mouth gently when interacting with people will be less likely to bite hard and break skin if he ever bites someone in a situation apart from play—like when he’s afraid or in pain.%&07%Puppies usually learn bite inhibition during play with other puppies. If you watch a group of puppies playing, you’ll see plenty of chasing, pouncing and wrestling. Puppies also bite each other all over. Every now and then, a pup will bite his playmate too hard. The victim of the painful bite yelps and usually stops playing. The offender is often taken aback by the yelp and also stops playing for a moment. However, pretty soon, both playmates are back in the game. Through this kind of interaction, puppies learn to control the intensity of their bites so that no one gets hurt and the play can continue without interruption. If puppies can learn how to be gentle from each other, they can also learn the same lesson from people.%&07%When you play with your puppy, let him mouth on your hands. Continue play until he bites especially hard. When he does, immediately give a high-pitched yelp, as if you’re hurt, and let your hand go limp. This should startle your puppy and cause him to stop mouthing you, at least momentarily. (If yelping seems to have no effect, you can say “Too bad!” or “You blew it!” in a stern voice instead.) Praise your puppy for stopping or for licking you. Resume whatever you were doing before. If your puppy bites you hard again, yelp again. Repeat these steps no more than three times within a 15-minute period. If you find that yelping alone doesn’t work, you can switch to a time-out procedure. Time-outs are often very effective for curbing mouthing in puppies. When your puppy delivers a hard bite, yelp loudly. Then, when he startles and turns to look at you or looks around, remove your hand. Either ignore him for 10 to 20 seconds or, if he starts mouthing on you again, get up and move away for 10 to 20 seconds. After the short time-out, return to your puppy and encourage him to play with you again. It’s important to teach him that gentle play continues, but painful play stops. Play with your puppy until he bites hard again. When he does, repeat the sequence above. When your puppy isn’t delivering really hard bites anymore, you can tighten up your rules a little. Require your puppy to be even gentler. Yelp and stop play in response to moderately hard bites. Persist with this process of yelping and then ignoring your puppy or giving him a time-out for his hardest bites. As those disappear, do the same for his next-hardest bites, and so on, until your puppy can play with your hands very gently, controlling the force of his mouthing so that you feel little or no pressure at all.%&07%What to Do Next: Teach Your Puppy That Teeth Don’t Belong on Human Skin%&07%• Substitute a toy or chew bone when your puppy tries to gnaw on fingers or toes.%&07%• Puppies often mouth on people’s hands when stroked, patted and scratched (unless they’re sleepy or distracted). If your puppy gets all riled up when you pet him, distract him by feeding him small treats from your other hand. This will help your puppy get used to being touched without mouthing.%&07%• Encourage noncontact forms of play, such as fetch and tug-of-war, rather than wrestling and rough play with your hands. Once your puppy can play tug safely, keep tug toys in your pocket or have them easily accessible. If he starts to mouth you, you can immediately redirect him to the tug toy. Ideally, he’ll start to anticipate and look for a toy when he feels like mouthing.%&07%• If your puppy bites at your feet and ankles, carry his favorite tug toy in your pocket. Whenever he ambushes you, instantly stop moving your feet. Take out the tug toy and wave it enticingly. When your puppy grabs the toy, start moving again. If you don’t happen to have the toy available, just freeze and wait for your puppy to stop mouthing you. The second he stops, praise and get a toy to reward him. Repeat these steps until your puppy gets used to watching you move around without going after your feet or ankles.%&07%• Provide plenty of interesting and new toys so that your puppy will play with them instead of gnawing on you or your clothing.%&07%• Provide plenty of opportunities for your puppy to play with other puppies and with friendly, vaccinated adult dogs. Playing and socializing with dog buddies is important for your puppy’s development—and if he expends a lot of his energy playing with other puppies, he’ll feel less motivated to play roughly with you. Consider enrolling your puppy in a good puppy class, where he can have supervised playtime with other puppies and learn some important new skills!%&07%• Use a time-out procedure, just like the one described above—but change the rules a little. Instead of giving your puppy time-outs for hard biting, start to give him time-outs every time you feel his teeth touch your skin.%&07%o The instant you feel your puppy’s teeth touch you, give a high-pitched yelp. Then immediately walk away from him. Ignore him for 30 to 60 seconds. If your puppy follows you or continues to bite and nip at you, leave the room for 30 to 60 seconds. (Be sure that the room is “puppy-proofed” before you leave your puppy alone in it. Don’t leave him in an area with things he might destroy or things that might hurt him.) After the brief time-out, return to the room and calmly resume whatever you were doing with your puppy.%&07%o Alternatively, you can keep a leash attached to your puppy during time-out training and let it drag on the floor when you’re there to supervise him.","dog, mounting, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/dog20.png?alt=media&token=f10ad9a5-294f-4b32-b372-43e3adfb3a0b
"Mouthing, Nipping and Play Biting in Adult Dogs",ASPCA,"Most pet parents don’t enjoy dogs who bite, chew and mouth their hands, limbs or clothing during play and interaction. The jaws of an adult dog can cause significantly more pain than puppy teeth, and adult dogs can inadvertently cause injury while mouthing. Mouthing is often more difficult to suppress in adult dogs because adults aren’t as sensitive to our reactions as puppies are, and they’re usually more difficult to control physically because of their size.%&07%Adult dogs who mouth people probably never learned not to do so during puppyhood. It’s likely that their human parents didn’t teach them how to be gentle or to chew toys instead.%&07%Is It Playful Mouthing or Aggressive Behavior?%&07%Most mouthing is normal dog behavior. But some dogs bite out of fear or frustration, and this type of biting can indicate problems with aggression. It’s sometimes difficult to tell the difference between normal play mouthing and mouthing that precedes aggressive behavior. In most cases, a playful dog will have a relaxed body and face. His muzzle might look wrinkled, but you won’t see a lot of tension in his facial muscles. Playful mouthing is usually less painful than more serious, aggressive biting. Most of the time, an aggressive dog’s body will look stiff. He may wrinkle his muzzle and pull back his lips to expose his teeth. Serious, aggressive bites are usually quicker and more painful than those delivered during play.%&07%If you suspect that your dog’s biting fits the description of aggressive behavior, please consult a qualified professional, such as a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB or ACAAB) or a board-certified veterinary behaviorist (Dip ACVB). If you can’t find a behaviorist in your area, you can seek help from a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT), but be sure that the trainer you choose is qualified to help you. Determine whether she or he has extensive education and experience successfully treating aggression, since this expertise isn’t required for CPDT certification.%&07%How to Minimize Your Dog’s Mouthing and Nipping%&07%Dogs spend a great deal of time playing, chewing and investigating objects. They also enjoy playing with people, of course. Puppies chew on our fingers and toes, and they investigate people’s bodies with their mouths and teeth.

Try the following tips:%&07%• Substitute a toy or chew bone when your dog tries to gnaw on fingers or toes.%&07%• Dogs often mouth on people’s hands when stroked, patted and scratched.

Teaching your dog to play tug-of-war prepares him for dealing with arousal and frustration. To keep tug-of-war safe and fun for you and your dog, you’ll need to follow strict rules. Once your dog can play tug safely, keep tug toys in your pocket or in a place where you can easily access them. If he starts to mouth you, you can immediately redirect him to the tug toy. Ideally, he’ll start to anticipate and look for a toy when he feels like mouthing.%&07%• Teach your dog impulse control with specific exercises such as sit, wait and leave it.%&07%• If your dog bites at your feet and ankles, carry his favorite tug toy in your pocket.

(Be sure that the room is “dog-proofed” before you leave your dog alone in it. Don’t leave him in an area with things he might destroy or things that might hurt him.) After the brief time-out, return to the room and calmly resume whatever you were doing with your dog.%&07% Alternatively, you can keep a leash attached to your dog when you’re around to supervise him. Let the leash drag on the floor. Instead of leaving the room when your dog mouths you, you can immediately take hold of his leash and calmly lead him to a quiet area. When you get there, tether him to a heavy piece of furniture or put him behind a baby gate to confine him. Then leave the area or turn your back to your dog for the brief time-out. When the time-out is over, untie him or release him, and resume whatever you were doing.%&07%• If a time-out isn’t viable or effective, consider using a taste deterrent. Spray the deterrent on areas of your body and clothing that your dog likes to mouth before you start interacting with him. If he mouths you or your clothing, stop moving and wait for him to react to the bad taste of the deterrent. Praise him lavishly when he lets go of you. Apply the deterrent to your body and clothes for at least two weeks. After two weeks of being punished by the bitter taste every time he mouths you, your dog will likely learn to inhibit his mouthy behavior.%&07%• If your dog shows no reaction when you yelp, does not stop mouthing when you use time-out and isn’t deterred by bad tastes, another possibility is to make it unpleasant for him when he mouths. The following technique should only be used as a last resort—only if nothing else has worked. Carry a small can of peppermint or spearmint breath spray in your pocket so that it’s always handy. The instant your dog starts to mouth you, yell “Ouch!” and squirt a short burst of the breath spray directly into your dog’s mouth. He won’t like the taste, and he really won’t like the sensation of the spray. Your action should be swift and smooth. This tactic won’t work if it deteriorates into a wrestling match between you and your dog—and it definitely won’t work if your dog becomes aggressive or afraid of you. You should only need to use the spray a few times. If you’re uncomfortable using punishment and can’t implement it quickly and without struggling with your dog, it’s best to use the other procedures recommended here or seek professional help.%&07%General Precautions%&07%• Avoid waving your fingers or toes in your dog’s face or slapping the sides of his face to entice him to play. Doing these things can actually encourage your dog to bite your hands and feet.%&07%• Do not discourage your dog from playing with you in general. Play builds a strong bond between a dog and his human family. You want to teach your dog to play gently rather than not at all.%&07%• Avoid jerking your hands or feet away from your dog when he mouths. Jerky movements might seem like a game to your dog and encourage him to jump forward and grab at you. It’s much more effective to let your hands or feet go limp so that they aren’t much fun to play with.%&07%• Slapping or hitting dogs for playful mouthing can cause them to bite harder. They usually react by playing more aggressively. Physical punishment can also make your dog afraid of you—and it can even cause real aggression. Avoid scruff shaking, whacking your dog on the nose, sticking your fingers down his throat and all other punishments that might hurt or scare him.","dog, mounting, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/dog21.png?alt=media&token=2e68f2e1-8513-4c80-b432-6040fc00d1cc
Separation Anxiety,ASPCA,"One of the most common complaints of pet parents is that their dogs are disruptive or destructive when left alone. Their dogs might urinate, defecate, bark, howl, chew, dig or try to escape. Although these problems often indicate that a dog needs to be taught polite house manners, they can also be symptoms of distress. When a dog’s problems are accompanied by other distress behaviors, such as drooling and showing anxiety when his pet parents prepare to leave the house, they aren’t evidence that the dog isn’t house trained or doesn’t know which toys are his to chew. Instead, they are indications that the dog has separation anxiety. Separation anxiety is triggered when dogs become upset because of separation from their guardians, the people they’re attached to. Escape attempts by dogs with separation anxiety are often extreme and can result in self-injury and household destruction, especially around exit points like windows and doors.%&07%Some dogs suffering from separation anxiety become agitated when their guardians prepare to leave. Others seem anxious or depressed prior to their guardians’ departure or when their guardians aren’t present. Some try to prevent their guardians from leaving. Usually, right after a guardian leaves a dog with separation anxiety, the dog will begin barking and displaying other distress behaviors within a short time after being left alone—often within minutes. When the guardian returns home, the dog acts as though it’s been years since he’s seen his mom or dad!%&07%When treating a dog with separation anxiety, the goal is to resolve the dog’s underlying anxiety by teaching him to enjoy, or at least tolerate, being left alone. This is accomplished by setting things up so that the dog experiences the situation that provokes his anxiety, namely being alone, without experiencing fear or anxiety.%&07%Common Symptoms of Separation Anxiety%&07%The following is a list of symptoms that may indicate separation anxiety:%&07%Urinating and Defecating%&07%Some dogs urinate or defecate when left alone or separated from their guardians. If a dog urinates or defecates in the presence of his guardian, his house soiling probably isn’t caused by separation anxiety.%&07%Barking and Howling%&07%A dog who has separation anxiety might bark or howl when left alone or when separated from his guardian. This kind of barking or howling is persistent and doesn’t seem to be triggered by anything except being left alone.%&07%Chewing, Digging and Destruction%&07%Some dogs with separation anxiety chew on objects, door frames or window sills, dig at doors and doorways, or destroy household objects when left alone or separated from their guardians. These behaviors can result in self-injury, such as broken teeth, cut and scraped paws and damaged nails. If a dog’s chewing, digging and destruction are caused by separation anxiety, they don’t usually occur in his guardian’s presence.%&07%Escaping%&07%A dog with separation anxiety might try to escape from an area where he’s confined when he’s left alone or separated from his guardian. The dog might attempt to dig and chew through doors or windows, which could result in self-injury, such as broken teeth, cut and scraped front paws and damaged nails. If the dog’s escape behavior is caused by separation anxiety, it doesn’t occur when his guardian is present.%&07%Pacing%&07%Some dogs walk or trot along a specific path in a fixed pattern when left alone or separated from their guardians. Some pacing dogs move around in circular patterns, while others walk back and forth in straight lines. If a dog’s pacing behavior is caused by separation anxiety, it usually doesn’t occur when his guardian is present.%&07%Coprophagia%&07%When left alone or separated from their guardians, some dogs defecate and then consume all or some of their excrement. If a dog eats excrement because of separation anxiety, he probably doesn’t perform that behavior in the presence of his guardian.%&07%Why Do Some Dogs Develop Separation Anxiety?%&07%There is no conclusive evidence showing exactly why dogs develop separation anxiety. However, because far more dogs who have been adopted from shelters have this behavior problem than those kept by a single family since puppyhood, it is believed that loss of an important person or group of people in a dog’s life can lead to separation anxiety. Other less dramatic changes can also trigger the disorder. The following is a list of situations that have been associated with development of separation anxiety.%&07%Change of Guardian or Family%&07%Being abandoned, surrendered to a shelter or given to a new guardian or family can trigger the development of separation anxiety.%&07%Change in Schedule%&07%An abrupt change in schedule in terms of when or how long a dog is left alone can trigger the development of separation anxiety. For example, if a dog’s guardian works from home and spends all day with his dog but then gets a new job that requires him to leave his dog alone for six or more hours at a time, the dog might develop separation anxiety because of that change.%&07%Change in Residence%&07%Moving to a new residence can trigger the development of separation anxiety.%&07%Change in Household Membership%&07%The sudden absence of a resident family member, either due to death or moving away, can trigger the development of separation anxiety.%&07%Medical Problems to Rule Out First%&07%Incontinence Caused by Medical Problems%&07%Some dogs’ house soiling is caused by incontinence, a medical condition in which a dog “leaks” or voids his bladder. Dogs with incontinence problems often seem unaware that they’ve soiled. Sometimes they void urine while asleep. A number of medical issues—including a urinary tract infection, a weak sphincter caused by old age, hormone-related problems after spay surgery, bladder stones, diabetes, kidney disease, Cushing’s disease, neurological problems and abnormalities of the genitalia—can cause urinary incontinence in dogs. Before attempting behavior modification for separation anxiety, please see your dog’s veterinarian to rule out medical issues.%&07%Medications%&07%There are a number of medications that can cause frequent urination and house soiling. If your dog takes any medications, please contact his veterinarian to find out whether or not they might contribute to his house-soiling problems.%&07%Other Behavior Problems to Rule Out%&07%Sometimes it’s difficult to determine whether a dog has separation anxiety or not. Some common behavior problems can cause similar symptoms. Before concluding that your dog has separation anxiety, it’s important to rule out the following behavior problems:%&07%Submissive or Excitement Urination%&07%Some dogs may urinate during greetings, play, physical contact or when being reprimanded or punished. Such dogs tend to display submissive postures during interactions, such as holding the tail low, flattening the ears back against the head, crouching or rolling over and exposing the belly. %&07%Incomplete House Training%&07%A dog who occasionally urinates in the house might not be completely house trained. His house training might have been inconsistent or it might have involved punishment that made him afraid to eliminate while his owner is watching or nearby.%&07%Urine Marking%&07%Some dogs urinate in the house because they’re scent marking. A dog scent marks by urinating small amounts on vertical surfaces. Most male dogs and some female dogs who scent mark raise a leg to urinate. %&07%Juvenile Destruction%&07%Many young dogs engage in destructive chewing or digging while their guardians are home as well as when they’re away. Please see our articles, Destructive Chewing, for more information about these problems.%&07%Boredom%&07%Dogs need mental stimulation, and some dogs can be disruptive when left alone because they’re bored and looking for something to do. These dogs usually don’t appear anxious.%&07%Excessive Barking or Howling%&07%Some dogs bark or howl in response to various triggers in their environments, like unfamiliar sights and sounds. They usually vocalize when their guardians are home as well as when they’re away. For more information about this kind of problem, please see our articles, Barking and Howling. %&07%What to Do If Your Dog Has Separation Anxiety%&07%Treatment for Mild Separation Anxiety%&07%If your dog has a mild case of separation anxiety, counterconditioning might reduce or resolve the problem. Counterconditioning is a treatment process that changes an animal’s fearful, anxious or aggressive reaction to a pleasant, relaxed one instead. It’s done by associating the sight or presence of a feared or disliked person, animal, place, object or situation with something really good, something the dog loves. Over time, the dog learns that whatever he fears actually predicts good things for him. For dogs with separation anxiety, counterconditioning focuses on developing an association between being alone and good things, like delicious food. To develop this kind of association, every time you leave the house, you can offer your dog a puzzle toy stuffed with food that will take him at least 20 to 30 minutes to finish. For example, try giving your dog a KONG® stuffed with something really tasty, like low-fat cream cheese, spray cheese or low-fat peanut butter, frozen banana and cottage cheese, or canned dog food and kibble. A KONG can even be frozen so that getting all the food out takes even more of your dog’s time. Be sure to remove these special toys as soon as you return home so that your dog only has access to them and the high-value foods inside when he’s by himself. You can feed your dog all of his daily meals in special toys. For example, you can give your dog a KONG or two stuffed with his breakfast and some tasty treats every morning before going to work. Keep in mind, though, that this approach will only work for mild cases of separation anxiety because highly anxious dogs usually won’t eat when their guardians aren’t home.%&07%Treatment for Moderate to Severe Separation Anxiety%&07%Moderate or severe cases of separation anxiety require a more complex desensitization and counterconditioning program. In these cases, it’s crucial to gradually accustom a dog to being alone by starting with many short separations that do not produce anxiety and then gradually increasing the duration of the separations over many weeks of daily sessions.%&07%The following steps briefly describe a desensitization and counterconditioning program. Please keep in mind that this is a short, general explanation. %&07%Desensitization and counterconditioning are complex and can be tricky to carry out. Fear must be avoided or the procedure will backfire and the dog will get more frightened. Because treatment must progress and change according to the pet’s reactions, and because these reactions can be difficult to read and interpret, desensitization and counterconditioning require the guidance of a trained and experienced professional. For help designing and carrying out a desensitization and counterconditioning plan, consult a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB or ACAAB) or a board-certified veterinary behaviorist (Dip ACVB). If you can’t find a behaviorist, you can seek help from a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT), but be sure that the trainer is qualified to help you. Determine whether she or he has education and experience in treating fear with desensitization and counterconditioning, since this kind of expertise isn’t required for CPDT certification.%&07%Step One: Predeparture Cues%&07%As mentioned above, some dogs begin to feel anxious while their guardians get ready to leave. For example, a dog might start to pace, pant and whine when he notices his guardian applying makeup, putting on shoes and a coat, and then picking up a bag or car keys. (If your dog doesn’t show signs of anxiety when you’re preparing to leave him alone, you can just skip to step two below.) Guardians of dogs who become upset during predeparture rituals are unable to leave—even for just few seconds—without triggering their dogs’ extreme anxiety. Your dog may see telltale cues that you’re leaving (like your putting on your coat or picking up your keys) and get so anxious about being left alone that he can’t control himself and forgets that you’ll come back.%&07%One treatment approach to this “predeparture anxiety” is to teach your dog that when you pick up your keys or put on your coat, it doesn’t always mean that you’re leaving. You can do this by exposing your dog to these cues in various orders several times a day—without leaving. For example, put on your boots and coat, and then just watch TV instead of leaving. Or pick up your keys, and then sit down at the kitchen table for awhile. This will reduce your dog’s anxiety because these cues won’t always lead to your departure, and so your dog won’t get so anxious when he sees them. Please be aware, though, that your dog has many years of learning the significance of your departure cues, so in order to learn that the cues no longer predict your long absences, your dog must experience the fake cues many, many times a day for many weeks. After your dog doesn’t become anxious when he sees you getting ready to leave, you can move on to the next step below.%&07%Step Two: Graduated Departures/Absences%&07%If your dog is less anxious before you leave, you can probably skip the predeparture treatment above and start with very short departures. The main rule is to plan your absences to be shorter than the time it takes for your dog to become anxious. So if your dog is only able to tolerate being alone for 5 minutes before becoming anxious, start with absences of 4 minutes or less. During these short departures, engage in a nonchalant routine, avoiding excessive attention or dramatic farewells. Simply leave the house for a few minutes and then return. Gradually increase the duration of your departures over time, always staying within your dog's comfort zone. It may take several weeks or even months to gradually work up to longer absences without triggering anxiety.%&07%During your absences, make sure your dog has access to enjoyable and stimulating activities. Provide puzzle toys, interactive feeders, or stuffed KONG toys to keep him engaged. Consider leaving a TV or radio on at low volume to provide some comforting background noise. You can also experiment with pheromone diffusers or calming music specifically designed for dogs to create a soothing environment.%&07%It's important to note that desensitization and counterconditioning should be carried out systematically and under the guidance of a professional if you're dealing with moderate to severe separation anxiety. They can provide a tailored plan and offer support throughout the process.%&07%Medication may also be considered in severe cases of separation anxiety. Consult with a veterinarian or veterinary behaviorist to discuss whether medication could be beneficial for your dog's specific situation.%&07%Remember, addressing separation anxiety requires patience, consistency, and understanding. With the right approach and appropriate interventions, many dogs can improve their ability to cope with being alone and reduce their anxiety levels over time.","dog, anxiety, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/dog22.png?alt=media&token=67dc33ee-9609-4be7-a41d-3aec8e3427dc
Whining,ASPCA,"Whining is one of many forms of canine vocal communication. Dogs most commonly whine when they’re seeking attention, when they’re excited, when they’re anxious or when they’re trying to appease you.%&07%Why Do Dogs Whine?%&07%Appeasement Behavior%&07%Some dogs whine excessively when interacting with people and other dogs, usually while adopting a submissive posture (e.g., tail tucked, body lowered, head down, gaze averted).%&07%Greeting Behavior%&07%Some dogs whine during greetings. This kind of vocalization is usually motivated by excitement and may be directed at dogs or people.%&07%Seeking Attention%&07%Some dogs whine in the presence of their owners in order to get attention, rewards or desired objects.%&07%Anxiety%&07%Some dogs whine in response to stressful situations. In this context, whining sometimes seems involuntarily.%&07%Other Problems That Might Cause Whining%&07%Separation Anxiety%&07%If your dog only whines just before you leave or during your absence, she may have separation anxiety. If this is the case, your dog will usually display at least one other symptom of the disorder prior to your departure or when left alone, such as pacing, panting, excessive drooling, destruction%&07%Injury or Medical Condition%&07%Dogs often whine in response to pain or a painful condition. If you notice that your dog vocalizes frequently or has suddenly started to vocalize, it’s important to take her to the vet to rule out medical causes.%&07%What to Do About Excessive Whining%&07%Appeasement Whining%&07%Dogs can try to appease people or other dogs when they perceive a threat or aggression being directed at them. Appeasement behaviors include holding the ears back, tucking the tail, crouching or rolling over on the back, avoiding eye contact or turning the body sideways to the perceived threat. Appeasement whining is also a normal canine behavior. You may be able to reduce your dog’s appeasement whining by building her confidence. Try taking her to an obedience class that uses reward-based training techniques. You and your dog can also try trick-training classes or dog sports like agility, flyball and musical freestyle (a combination of heeling and tricks performed to music). Playing fun, interactive games with your dog, like tug and fetch, can increase your dog’s confidence. Avoid physical and verbal punishment. Avoid physical and verbal punishment. Intimidating your dog will only decrease her confidence level and may increase appeasement whining.%&07%Whining During Greetings%&07%If your dog whines when greeting people, you can divert her attention to her favorite toys. Simply telling your dog to be quiet during greetings usually isn’t effective because, unless you’ve taken specific steps to teach your dog what the word “Quiet” means, she won’t understand you. Additionally, most dogs whine when greeting people because they’re excited, and in an extremely aroused state, they may not have control over their behavior. Instead, use management procedures to help prevent your dog from becoming overly excited. For example, downplay greetings, keeping them short and simple. Avoid speaking in excited, loud tones, and keep your movements slow and calm. Wait to pet and interact with your dog until she’s less excited. It may also help to teach her to do something you’d like her to do instead of whining, such as sitting or hand targeting when she greets you or other people. Your dog may whine a lot less if she’s busy performing some other, more polite behavior instead.%&07%How to Teach Hand Targeting%&07%Try teaching your dog to touch an outstretched palm with her nose during greetings to help her stay calm.%&07%•\tHold your outstretched palm right in front of your dog’s face, and wait for her to touch it with the tip of her nose. Don’t say anything. Just wait. If she isn’t paying attention at all, you can say her name to get her focused on you, but don’t say anything else and don’t move your hand toward your dog. Your touching your palm to her nose won’t help teach her to move her nose toward your palm. If your dog doesn’t touch your hand at first, you can try removing it and then presenting it again, or moving it side to side in front of her face, or rubbing a treat on your palm to encourage your dog to sniff it. As soon as you feel your dog’s nose touch your palm, say “Yes!” and feed her a small treat from your other hand.%&07%•\tWhen your dog touches your palm reliably 9 out of 10 times in a row, start to present your hand in different places. Hold it out to the side of your dog’s face, down toward the floor and a few inches away so that your dog has to move toward it to make contact. Finally, hold your palm up above her head so she has to reach up to touch it. Always remember to say “Yes!” as soon as you feel your dog’s nose make contact with your hand, and then feed her a treat.%&07%•\tWhen your dog touches your hand 9 out of 10 times in a row, regardless of where you’re holding it, then introduce a cue or command for the behavior, such as, “Say hello.” First say the cue then present your hand and wait for your dog to touch it. When she does, say “Yes!” and give her a treat.%&07%•\tIncorporate your dog’s friends and family into the training. Practice her new skill in a variety of places: your home, a friend’s home and on the street during leash walks. Ask friends who your dog knows and likes and who walk along your regular route and stop to greet your dog so she can practice hand targeting with them. Remember to keep rewarding her when she responds correctly.%&07%•\tThe next step is to generalize the training to people your dog doesn’t know. In advance, tell a friend who’s never met your dog what to do when meeting her. Then invite the person to your home or arrange to meet while you’re taking a walk with your dog. During the meeting, if the stranger presents his or her hand and your dog seems confused, help her out. Remind her what to do by asking her to touch your hand first a few times. Then ask the stranger to try again.%&07%•\tFrom this point on, if someone wants to greet your dog, either in your home or out in the world, explain that he or she should simply put out a hand and wait for your dog to approach. You can cue your dog by saying, “Say hello.” After your dog touches the person’s hand with her nose, she’ll turn back to you for her treat. In the event that the person ignores your request and reaches out to pat your dog, she should feel relatively relaxed because she’s expecting the person to extend a hand to be touched!%&07%•\tBe careful not to reward your dog if she performs this new behavior when you haven’t asked her to do so by at least raising your hand to her. Some dogs can get pushy and will approach people to touch their hands, even when the people do not want to interact. Reward your dog for touching only when you’ve given the cue.%&07%Attention-Seeking Whining%&07%If your dog uses whining behavior to seek attention, rewards or desired objects, you need to teach her that remaining quiet is a better strategy. Sometimesreducing attention-seeking whining may be difficult because owners may unwittingly reinforce the behavior. Realize that any eye contact, touching or talking to your dog—even if you’re scolding her—all constitute attention. Use dramatic body language such as turning away from your dog or folding your arms across your chest and completely ignore her to indicate to your dog that her attention-seeking whining won’t work.%&07%In addition to not reinforcing whining behavior, you need to reward your dog for being quiet. Teach your dog that she must always be quiet before receiving your attention, play or treats. Regularly seek out your dog to give her attention and rewards when she’s not whining. When your dog understands that silence works well to get your attention, she won’t feel as motivated to whine.%&07%Don’t hesitate to contact a Certified Professional Dog Trainer (CPDT) in your area. Many CPDTs offer group or private classes that can give you and your dog lots of great skills to learn and games to play that will reduce her appeasement whining, whining during greetings and attention-seeking whining.%&07%Anxious Whining%&07%Whining as a result of anxiety is difficult to eliminate unless the cause of anxiety is removed. Anxious whining is usually accompanied by other nervous behaviors, such as pacing, circling and licking. Many anxious dogs do not seem able to control their whining when under extreme stress.%&07%Some medications may help reduce your dog’s anxiety. Consult a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB or ACAAB) or a board-certified veterinary behaviorist (Dip ACVB).","dog, whining, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/dog23.png?alt=media&token=67656aa0-0176-4f6c-8d96-6b07d3bdaad7
Cancer in dog,ASPCA,"Cancer is a class of diseases in which cells grow uncontrollably, invade surrounding tissue and may spread to other areas of the body. As with people, dogs can get various kinds of cancer. The disease can be localized (confined to one area, like a tumor) or generalized (spread throughout the body).%&07%Causes of Cancer%&07%Cancer is a “multifactorial” disease, which means it has no known single cause. However, we do know that both hereditary and environmental factors can contribute to the development of cancer in dogs.%&07%Cancer Symptoms%&07%Symptoms of cancer in dogs may include:%&07%•Lumps (which are not always malignant, but should always be examined by a vet)%&07%•Swelling%&07%•Persistent sores%&07%•Abnormal discharge from any part of the body%&07%•Bad breath%&07%•Listlessness/lethargy%&07%•Rapid, often unexplained weight loss%&07%•Sudden lameness%&07%•Black, tarry stools (a symptom of ulcers, which can be caused by mast cell tumors)%&07%•Decreased or loss of appetite.%&07%•Difficulty breathing, urinating, or defecating.%&07%Diagnosing Cancer in Dogs%&07%•If a lump is present, the first step is typically a needle biopsy, which removes a very small tissue sample for microscopic examination of cells. Alternately, surgery may be performed to remove all or part of the lump for diagnosis by a pathologist.%&07%•Radiographs (xrays), ultrasound, blood evaluation and other diagnostic tests may also be helpful in determining if cancer is present or if it has spread.%&07%Dogs More Prone to Cancer%&07%•Though cancer can be diagnosed in dogs of all ages and breeds, it is much more common in older dogs.%&07%•Certain breeds are prone to specific cancers. Boxers, Boston terriers and Golden Retrievers are among the breeds that most commonly develop mast cell tumors or lymphoma, while large and giant breeds like Great Danes and Saint Bernards are much more likely to suffer from bone cancer than smaller breeds.%&07%It is important to be familiar with the diseases to which your dog might have a breed disposition.%&07%Cancer Prevention%&07%•Having your dog altered at a young age can dramatically reduce their chance of getting certain types of cancer.%&07%•Breast cancer can be avoided almost completely by having your dog spayed before her first heat cycle, while a neutered male dog has zero chance of developing testicular cancer.%&07%Cancer Treatments%&07%•Treatment options vary and depend on the type and stage of cancer.%&07%•Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapy or a combination of therapies. Success of treatment depends on the type and extent of the cancer and the aggressiveness of the therapy. Of course, early detection is best.%&07%•Some dog owners opt for no treatment of the cancer, in which case palliative end of life care, including pain relief, should be considered. Regardless of how you proceed after a diagnosis of cancer in your pet, it is very important to consider his quality of life when making future decisions.%&07%•Some cancers can be cured, while others cannot. Please note that if your dog’s cancer is not curable, there are still many things you can do to make your pet feel better. Don’t hesitate to talk to your vet about your options. And remember good nutrition and loving care can greatly enhance your dog’s quality of life.%&07%When to See the Vet%&07%Contact your veterinarian immediately if your dog shows any of the clinical signs mentioned on the list above. Should your dog receive a diagnosis of cancer, you may wish to consult a veterinary oncologist, often employed by specialty veterinary practices and teaching hospitals.%&07%","dog, diseases",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/dog24.png?alt=media&token=88eec38c-cd52-4f7a-af54-d178e10a784d
Diabetes in dog,ASPCA,"Diabetes in dogs is a complex disease caused by either a lack of the hormone insulin or an inadequate response to insulin. After a dog eats, his digestive system breaks food into various components, including glucose—which is carried into his cells by insulin, a hormone secreted by the pancreas. When a dog does not produce insulin or cannot utilize it normally, his blood sugar levels elevate. The result is hyperglycemia, which, if left untreated, can cause many complicated health problems for a dog.%&07%It is important to understand that diabetes is considered a manageable disorder—and many diabetic dogs can lead happy, healthy lives.%&07%Diabetes can be classified as:%&07%•Type I (lack of insulin production)%&07%•Type II (impaired insulin production along with an inadequate response to the hormone).%&07%The most common form of the disease in dogs is Type I, insulin-dependent diabetes, which occurs when the pancreas is incapable of producing or secreting adequate levels of insulin. Dogs who have Type I diabetes require insulin therapy to survive.%&07%Diabetes Symptoms in Dogs%&07%The following are signs that your dog may be diabetic:%&07%•Change in appetite.%&07%•Excessive thirst/increase in water consumption%&07%•Weight loss%&07%•Increased urination%&07%•Unusually sweet-smelling or fruity breath%&07%•Lethargy%&07%•Dehydration%&07%•Urinary tract infections%&07%•Vomiting%&07%•Cataract formation, blindness%&07%•Chronic skin infections%&07%Causes of Diabetes%&07%The exact cause of diabetes is unknown. Autoimmune disease, genetics, obesity, chronic pancreatitis, certain medications and abnormal protein deposits in the pancreas can play a major role in the development of the disease.%&07%Dogs More Prone to Diabetes%&07%•It is thought that obese dogs and female dogs may run a greater risk of developing diabetes later in life (6-9 years of age)%&07%•Some breeds may also have a greater risk, include Australian Terriers, Standard and Miniature Schnauzers, Dachshunds, Poodles, Keeshonds and Samoyeds%&07%•Juvenile diabetes can also be seen and is particularly prevalent in golden retrievers and keeshonds%&07%Diagnosing Diabetes%&07%To properly diagnose diabetes, your veterinarian will collect information about clinical signs, perform a physical examination and check blood work and urinalysis.%&07%Treating Diabetes%&07%•Every diabetic dog is an individual and will respond differently to therapy. Diabetes treatment is based on how severe the signs of disease are and whether there are any other health issues that could complicate therapy.%&07%•Some dogs are seriously ill when first diagnosed and require intensive hospitalized care for several days to regulate their blood sugar levels.%&07%•Dogs who are more stable when first diagnosed may respond to oral medication or a high-fiber diet that helps to normalize glucose levels in the blood%&07%•For most dogs, insulin injections are necessary for adequate regulation of blood glucose. Once your pet’s individual insulin treatment is established, typically based on weight, you will be shown how to give him his insulin injections at home.%&07%•Spaying your dog is recommended, as female sex hormones can have an effect on blood sugar levels.%&07%As your veterinarian will explain, it’s important to always give your dog insulin at the same time every day and feed him regular meals in conjunction with his medication; this allows increased nutrients in the blood to coincide with peak insulin levels. This will lessen the chance that her sugar levels will swing either too high or too low. You can work with your vet to create a feeding schedule around your pet’s medication time. It is also important to avoid feeding your diabetic dog treats that are high in glucose. Regular blood glucose checks are a critical part of monitoring and treating any diabetic patient, and your veterinarian will help you set up a schedule for checking your dog’s blood sugar.%&07%Diabetes Prevention%&07%Although a certain form of diabetes—the type found in dogs less than a year of age—is inherited, proper diet and regular exercise can go a long way to avoid the development of diabetes. Aside from other negative effects, obesity is known to contribute to insulin resistance.%&07%When to See the Vet%&07%If your dog is showing any abnormal clinical signs as listed above, make an appointment to see your veterinarian immediately. If a diabetic dog is not treated, he can develop secondary health problems like cataracts and severe urinary tract problems. Ultimately, untreated diabetes can cause coma and death.%&07%","dog, diseases",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/dog13.png?alt=media&token=5b76b39e-2a4c-4bc8-a579-fd29de64de80
Heartworm in dog,ASPCA,"Heartworm is a parasitic worm that lives in the heart and pulmonary arteries of an infected animal. The worms travel through the bloodstream—harming arteries and vital organs as they go—ultimately completing their journey to the vessels of the lung and the heart chamber about six months after the initial infection. Several hundred worms can live in one dog for five to seven years.%&07%Heartworm disease is serious and can be fatal.%&07%Heartworm Symptoms%&07%Symptoms of heartworm can include:%&07%•Labored breathing%&07%•Coughing%&07%•Vomiting%&07%•Weight loss, listlessness, and fatigue after only moderate exercise%&07%•Some dogs exhibit no symptoms at all until late stages of infection%&07%Heartworm Causes%&07%•Heartworms are transmitted from animal to animal by mosquitoes.%&07%•An animal must carry at least two heartworms (a male and a female) in order for female heartworms to reproduce.%&07%•Females produce babies called “microfilaria,” which are shed into an animal’s bloodstream but are not capable of directly causing heartworm without first passing through a mosquito.%&07%•Microfilariae must be taken up by biting mosquitoes, and transform into infective larvae over a two-week period inside the insect.%&07%•When a mosquito next bites a susceptible animal, the infective larvae enter the tissues and begin a migration into the blood vessels.%&07%•Heartworms enter an animal’s bloodstream as tiny, invisible larvae, but can reach lengths of more than twelve inches at maturity.%&07%Diagnosing Heartworm%&07%•Heartworm disease is diagnosed by examination, radiographs or ultrasound, and a veterinarian-administered blood test.%&07%•All dogs should be routinely screened with a blood test for heartworm either annually in spring or before being placed on a new prescription for a heartworm preventative.%&07%Dogs More Prone to Heartworm%&07%•Heartworm infestation can happen to any dog, but since mosquitoes are their carriers, dogs who live in hot, humid regions are at greatest risk.%&07%•The disease has been seen in every state except Alaska, but is most common in or on the East Coast, southern United States and Mississippi River Valley.%&07%Preventing Heartworm%&07%•Heartworm is easily preventable with an inexpensive, chewable pill or topical medication available as a vet’s prescription. The pills or topical are usually administered monthly and can be given to dogs under 6 months of age without a blood test. Older animals must be screened for the disease prior to starting medication.%&07%•The American Heartworm Society recommends keeping your dog on the medication all year long.

Rabies in dog,ASPCA,"Rabies is a viral disease that may affect the brain and spinal cord of all mammals, including cats, dogs and humans. This preventable disease has been reported in every state except Hawaii. There’s good reason that the very word “rabies” evokes fear in people—once symptoms appear, rabies is close to 100% fatal.%&07%Rabies Transmission%&07%There are several reported routes of transmission of the rabies virus.%&07%•Rabies is most often transmitted through a bite from an infected animal.%&07%•Less frequently, it can be passed on when the saliva of an infected animal enters another animal’s body through mucous membranes or an open, fresh wound.%&07%•The risk for contracting rabies runs highest if your dog is exposed to wild animals. Outbreaks can occur in populations of wild animals (most often raccoons, bats, skunks and foxes in this country) or in areas where there are significant numbers of unvaccinated, free-roaming dogs and cats.%&07%Rabies Prevention%&07%•Vaccination is the key—and in many areas of the country, such as New York City, it's the law.%&07%•Some local ordinances require lengthy quarantines—or euthanasia—of pets who have bitten someone if their owners do not have proof of current vaccination.%&07%•Vaccinating your dog doesn't just protect him from rabies—it also protects your dog if he bites someone. Dogs who have bitten humans are required to be confined for at least 10 days to see if rabies develops.%&07%•Avoiding contact with wild animals is also necessary to prevention. Walk your dog on a leash and supervise him while he’s outsoodrs.%&07%Symptoms of Rabies%&07%Animals will not show signs immediately following exposure to a rabid animal.

Avoid moving the box unless absolutely necessary, but if you must do so, move the box just a few inches per day. Keep in mind that cats won't use a messy, smelly litter box, so scoop solid waste out of the box at least once a day. Dump everything, wash with a mild detergent and refill at least once a week; you can do this less frequently if using clumping litter. Don't use ammonia, deodorants, or scents, especially lemon, when cleaning the litter box. If your cat will not use a litterbox, please consult with your veterinarian.

Aggression Between Cats in Your Household,ASPCA,"Some cats just won’t give peace a chance. There are several reasons that cats might not get along. The most common is undersocialization—a lack of pleasant experiences with other cats early in life. If your cat grew up as the only cat, with little or no contact with other felines, he may react strongly when he’s finally introduced to another cat because he’s afraid of the unknown, he lacks feline social skills, and he dislikes the disruption to his routine and environment. Cats tend to prefer consistency over change. This is especially true if the change involves a newcomer to your cat’s well-established territory. Cats are a territorial species. While some cats overlap their territories a great deal, others prefer to keep a good distance from their neighbors. Two unrelated males or two unrelated females may have a particularly hard time sharing space. Another cause of strife may be a feline personality clash. Cats usually don’t get to pick their housemates, and sometimes we humans just don’t select the right match. In some cases, however, cats get along just fine until something scary or unpleasant (like fireworks or the odor of the veterinary clinic) becomes associated with the other cat. In other cases, relationships change as the cats mature. If one cat reaches the age of one to three years old and then trouble brews, social maturation may be a factor.%&07%Any sudden change in your cat’s behavior could be an indication of an underlying medical condition. If you notice any unusual physical or behavioral symptoms, or if your cat stops eating, please see your veterinarian right away.%&07%Suggestions for Managing Your Cats%&07%• Never let the cats “fight it out.” Cats don’t resolve their issues through fighting, and the fighting usually just gets worse. Interrupt aggression with a loud clap of your hands or spray from a water gun.%&07%• Neuter the cats. Intact males are particularly prone to aggressive behavior.%&07%• Separate their resources. Reduce competition between the cats by providing multiple, identical food bowls, beds, and litter boxes in different areas of your house.%&07%• Provide additional perches. More hiding spots and perches will allow your cats to space themselves out as they prefer.%&07%• Don’t try to calm or soothe your aggressive cat, just leave her alone and give her space. If you come close, she could turn and redirect her aggression toward you.%&07%• Reward desired behavior. Praise or toss treats to reward your cats when you see them interacting in a friendly manner.%&07%• Try pheromones. You can purchase a product that mimics a natural cat odor (which humans can’t smell), that may reduce tension. Use a diffuser while the aggression issue is being resolved.%&07%If the Aggression Is Mild or Between Two Cats Who Used to Get Along%&07%• Separate your cats into different rooms for several days or weeks, with separate beds, bowls, and litter boxes. This way they can hear and smell each other, but don’t have to interact.%&07%• Place the cats’ food bowls on opposite sides of a closed door. This will encourage them to be close together while they’re doing something that makes them feel good.%&07%• Each day, have the cats switch rooms so that they both experience some variation and get access to each other’s scents. You may need an assistant to do this safely.%&07%• After several days, if both of your cats appear relaxed, crack the door open %&07% one inch. If they remain calm, open the door a bit more, then a bit more. If the cats remain relaxed, they may be ready to be together again. But if they react with any signs of aggressive behavior—such as growling, spitting, hissing, swatting, etc.—separate them again and follow the gradual reintroduction instructions below.%&07%• Some cat parents have had success with rubbing a bit of tuna juice on their cats’ bodies and heads. The cats become so occupied with grooming, which is a relaxing behavior, that they’re less likely to be bothered by the other cat. If things go really well, the cats may actually groom each other because they can’t reach the juice on their own heads.%&07%If the Aggression Is Severe or Occurs Between Cats Who Have Never Gotten Along%&07%• Separate your cats as described above but for a longer period of time, and reintroduce them at a much slower pace, like several days to a few weeks.%&07%• Instead of simply opening the door to reintroduce the cats, provide daily reintroduction sessions that very gradually move the cats closer and closer together under supervision.%&07%• During the sessions, you might find it easier to control your cats with harnesses and leashes, or by confining one or both of your cats in crates.%&07%• During the sessions, keep both cats distracted with food or play. Start out with them far apart. Keep the sessions short. Make it easy for them to succeed.%&07%• Separate your cats between reintroduction sessions to prevent a relapse.%&07%• Only when your cats can peacefully eat and play within a couple feet of each other should they be left alone together unsupervised. Trust them only for short periods together at first and increase their times together gradually.%&07%• Behavioral medication may be helpful in reducing a domineering cat’s aggression and a skittish cat’s fear, making the reintroduction go more smoothly and quickly.","cat, aggression, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-photos.appspot.com/o/cat%2F10.agression-between-cat.webp?alt=media&token=be070a03-1b47-4eb6-a4cd-54a3587d4de8
Aggression in Cats,ASPCA,"Aggression is the second most common feline behavior problem seen by animal behaviorists. Although cat aggression is sometimes taken less seriously than dog aggression—perhaps because cats are smaller and don’t pursue people to bite them—aggressive cats can be formidable. They have five potential weapons (their teeth and all four clawed paws) compared to a dogs’ sole weapon of his or her mouth. Cats can bite and inflict severe lacerations, which are painful and can easily become infected. They can also cause cat scratch fever, a usually benign but potentially serious infectious disease that causes flu-like symptoms. Fights between cats rarely result in fatalities, but they can lead to infections and result in considerable veterinary expenses for cat parents. Aggressive cats can be risky to have at home and can pose a real danger to family and visitors.%&07%%&07%What Is Aggression?%&07%Aggression is threatening or harmful behavior directed toward a person, another cat, or other animals. Virtually all wild animals display aggression to guard their territories, defend their offspring and protect themselves if attacked. Aggression refers to a wide variety of complex behaviors that occur for different reasons under various circumstances. In pet cats, aggressive behavior can range from cats who hiss and avoid the target of their aggression to cats who attack.%&07%%&07%Understanding Cat Body Language%&07%Understanding what cats are communicating through their body language is essential for cat parents. It enables them to more accurately “read” their cats and understand their feelings and motivations for doing what they do. It also helps them respond more effectively to behavior issues like aggression.%&07%%&07%Body language is made up of cats’ body postures, facial expressions, and the position and carriage of certain body parts, like ears, tail and even whiskers. Cat body language is more subtle than dog body language and can be harder for people to interpret. Knowing the basic postures and what they mean can help cat parents deal with problems more effectively and enjoy their cat’s company more fully because they can understand a common language.%&07%%&07%Threats and aggression can be either offensive or defensive. An offensively aggressive cat tries to make himself look bigger and more intimidating, whereas a defensively aggressive cat adopts a self-protective posture and tries to make himself look smaller. The following are typical postures seen in feline aggression. A rule of thumb is to not touch, attempt to reassure, or punish cats showing these postures! %&07%Offensive postures include:%&07%•A stiff, straight-legged upright stance%&07%•Stiffened rear legs, with the rear end raised and the back sloped downward toward the head.%&07%•Tail is stiff and lowered or held straight down to the ground.%&07%•Direct stare%&07%•Upright ears, with the backs rotated slightly forward.%&07%•Piloerection (hackles up), including fur on the tail.%&07%•Constricted pupils%&07%•Directly facing opponent, possibly moving toward him%&07%•Might be growling, howling or yowling.%&07%Defensive postures include:%&07%•Crouching%&07%•Head tucked in%&07%•Tail curved around the body and tucked in%&07%•Eyes wide open with pupils partially or fully dilated%&07%•Ears flattened sideways or backward on the head%&07%•Piloerection (hackles up)%&07%•In an anxious cat, whiskers might be retracted. In a fearful cat, whiskers might pan out and forward to assess distance between himself and the danger%&07%•Turning sideways to the opponent, not straight on%&07%•Open-mouthed hissing or spitting%&07%•Might deliver quick strikes with front paws, claws out%&07%Overt aggression, whether defensive or offensive, includes:%&07%•Swatting, striking with paws%&07%•Biting%&07%•Fighting%&07%•Growling, shrieking%&07%•Scratching%&07%•Preparing for an all-out attack by rolling onto side or back and exposing all weapons: teeth and claws%&07%•In this position, your cat might attempt to grab your hand and bring it to his mouth to bite it%&07%Classification of Aggressive Behavior%&07%If your cat has been aggressive in the past or you suspect he could become aggressive, take time to evaluate the situations that got him upset. Who did he aggressive toward? When and where did it happen? What was going on during the half-hour or so leading up to the incident? What was about to happen to your cat? Determining the answers to these questions can clarify the circumstances that trigger your cat’s aggressive reaction and provide insight into why he’s behaving this way. You need to understand the cause of your cat’s aggression and his motivation for it before you can help him.%&07%%&07%Keep in mind that a number of medical conditions can cause or contribute to your cat’s aggression, including toxoplasmosis, hyperthyroidism, epilepsy, abscesses, arthritis, dental disease, rabies, trauma, and sensory decline or cognitive dysfunction in older cats. The first step in resolving your cat’s aggression problem is to have a complete veterinary exam to assess his physical health. %&07%Aggressive behavior problems in cats can be classified in different ways. A good way to understand why your cat is aggressive is to think about the function or purpose of the aggression. If you consider all the reasons why cats behave aggressively, you can determine what motivates your cat to do so and identify what he might gain from his behavior.%&07%Between Cats%&07%The most obvious and easily understood type of aggression between cats occurs between unneutered males. As males reach adulthood, they often begin to challenge each other for access to mates and territory. Tom cats who roam will get into threatening stand-offs and actual fights. They sit or stand stiffly, their hackles up, and stare at each other. Their ears are swiveled backward, and they often growl, hiss and howl loudly. One cat might eventually slowly leave, or one or both of them might attack.%&07%%&07%Aggression between household cats is more subtle and complex than the conflicts between two outdoor toms. It can be so subtle, in fact, that cat parents don’t notice it. The aggressor cat postures, and the recipient makes himself look smaller and may break away to avoid the aggressor. The aggression can occur between females or between females and males. It can be related to physical size and activity (large cats often intimidate smaller or less active cats), to a lack of pleasant social experiences with other cats, to an accidentally learned association between the other cat and something unpleasant (like fireworks or thunder), or to a simple personality clash. Please see our article, Aggression Between Cats in Your Household, for more information about this problem.%&07%%&07%Fearful or Defensive%&07%Fear aggression can occur when a cat perceives a threat, and it escalates if he can’t escape. The more threatening the person, animal, object or sound seems to the cat, the more heightened his fear reaction will be. Typical body postures associated with fearful or defensive aggression are a combination of defensive signals (such as crouching, flattening the ears, tucking the tail, leaning away or rolling onto the side, and pupil dilation) and aggressive signals (such as hissing and spitting, piloerection, growling, swatting, biting and scratching). Aggressive signals are especially likely to be displayed if a cat can’t escape the thing he fears. Often the best way to deal with a defensively aggressive cat is to simply avoid him until he calms down.%&07%%&07%Territorial%&07%Animals of many species strive to expel or keep out other individuals from their territory, and cats are no exception. Both male and female cats are territorial, but males may defend larger territories than females. Cats’ territorial aggression is usually directly toward other cats, but it can be directed toward dogs and people, too. A cat can show territorial aggression toward some family members and not others and toward some cats but not others. Cats mark their turf by patrolling, chin rubbing and urine spraying. They may stalk, chase and ambush a targeted intruder while displaying offensive body postures, including hissing, swatting and growling. Some cats take a slow and steady approach in their stalking, while others immediately and aggressively give chase. A cat’s perceived territory could be the entire house or part of it, the yard, the block or the neighborhood.%&07%%&07%Some of the most common situations that trigger territoriality are:%&07%• A kitten in the household reaches sexual maturity%&07%• A new cat is introduced into the family and household%&07%• Major changes are made in the cat’s family or environment (for example, moving or someone moving in)%&07%• Stray or roaming cats in the neighborhood enter a cat’s territory%&07%%&07%Play%&07%Rough play is common and natural among kittens and young cats less than two years of age. Despite the playful intentions of a cat, however, when such play is directed toward people or becomes overly rambunctious, it can cause injury to people or damage household items. Play aggression is the most common type of aggressive behavior that cats direct toward their owners. It involves typical predatory and play behaviors, including stalking, chasing, attacking, running, ambushing, pouncing, leaping, batting, swatting, grasping, fighting and biting. It’s believed that through play with each other, young cats learn to inhibit their bites and sheathe their claws when swatting. The degree to which individual cats learn to inhibit their rough play varies, and those who were orphaned or weaned early might never have learned to temper their play behavior. Other factors that can contribute to play aggression are long hours spent alone without opportunities to play, and if pet parents encourage their cats to chase and attack people’s hands and feet in play.%&07%%&07%Redirected%&07%Redirected aggression is probably the most dangerous type of cat aggression because the bites are uninhibited and the attacks can be frightening and damaging. Unfortunately, it’s also a very common type of feline aggression. Redirected aggression occurs when a cat is aggressively aroused and agitated by an animal or person he can’t get at (because there’s a window between them, for example). Unable to get to the trigger of his agitation, he turns and lashes out at someone—person, dog or cat—who is nearby or who approaches him. There can be considerable delay between the initial arousal and the redirected aggression, as long as hours. This is why cat parents sometimes describe this kind of aggression as unprovoked or “out of the blue.” They weren’t even aware of the initial trigger (for example, a cat outside who passed by 30 minutes before the attack). A redirected attack occurs only if an agitated cat is approached or there’s someone close by. The cat won’t go looking for someone to attack! It’s not a malicious or even intentional type of aggression. It’s almost like a reflex, done automatically without thought. This is why it’s never a good idea to break up a cat fight or approach an agitated cat showing defensive or offensive aggression postures.%&07%%&07%Some common triggers for redirected aggression are:%&07%• Watching another cat through a door or window%&07%• Watching or stalking birds, squirrels or other prey animals%&07%• Smelling another cat’s odor on a family member, a visitor or clothing%&07%• Coming indoors after getting outside if the cat usually lives only indoors%&07%• Hearing high-pitched noises%&07%• Being frightened or harassed by a dog%&07%• Having a person intervene in a cat fight%&07%• Being in an animal shelter, surrounded by the sight, smell and sounds of other cats%&07%%&07%Petting-Induced%&07%Some cats enjoy being petted, held, carried and even hugged. Some merely tolerate these activities with their owners, or they like being petted but not carried. And a few don’t like being petted at all. Petting-induced aggression occurs when a cat suddenly feels irritated by being petted, nips or lightly bites the person petting him, and then jumps up and runs off. This type of aggression isn’t well understood, but behaviorists think that physical contact, like stroking, can quickly become unpleasant if it’s repeated over and over. Repetitive contact can cause arousal, excitement, pain and even static electricity in a cat’s fur. Imagine if someone rubbed your back but, instead of moving his hand all over your back, he rubbed in just one spot, over and over. That could quickly become unpleasant. Your cat might feel the same way: what started out feeling good is now irritating, and he wants you to stop. This type of aggression is more common in males than females. When your cat signals you to stop petting, the best response is simply to stop.%&07%%&07%With careful observation of your cat’s communication signals, you’ll usually see warning signs, such as:%&07%• Quickly turning his head toward a person’s hand%&07%• Twitching or flipping his tail%&07%• Flattening his ears or rotating them forward and back%&07%• Restlessness%&07%• Dilating pupils%&07%%&07%Pain-Induced and Irritable%&07%Pain-induced and irritable aggression are triggered by pain, frustration or deprivation, and they can be directed toward people, animals and objects. Any animal—including humans—can aggress when in pain. So even a well-socialized, normally docile cat can lash out when he’s hurt, when someone tries to touch a painful part of him (for example, to medicate his infected ears), or when he’s in pain and he anticipates being handled because someone is approaching him. Cats with aggression problems should always be examined for underlying medical problems, especially painful diseases such as arthritis, dental pain and abscesses from fighting. Painful punishment is not only ineffective for changing cat behavior, it can also trigger pain-induced aggression and worsen other types of aggression, like fear and territorial aggression. Body postures will usually be defensive.%&07%%&07%Maternal%&07%All mothers have instincts to protect their offspring from potential danger. Maternal aggression can occur when a mother cat (called the queen) with her kittens is approached by people or other animals whom she perceives as a threat. It’s more often directed and other cats, but it can be directed toward people, too. Queens can be quite aggressive when defending their young, especially in the first few days after birth. For this reason, it’s a good idea to avoid handling kittens during the first few days of their lives.%&07%%&07%Idiopathic%&07%The classification of idiopathic aggression includes any type of aggression whose cause can’t be determined or explained through behavior history or medical exam. Cats with this type of aggression can attack their owners violently. They may bite repeatedly and remain in an aroused state for long periods of time. Redirected aggression must be closely considered and ruled out as a possible cause before a diagnosis of idiopathic aggression is made. These cats are dangerous, and pet parents of such cats should carefully assess their quality of life, as well as the safety of those around them.%&07%%&07%Predatory%&07%Cats are predators, and predatory behaviors are completely natural and highly motivated behaviors for them. Many experts don’t classify predation as aggression because its purpose is to obtain food—unlike other types of aggression, which are responses to conflict. Cats are superb hunters. They use their acute vision and sensitivity to high-pitched sounds to locate their prey. They hunt insects, reptiles, rodents, young rabbits and birds. Most cats specialize in rodents, such as mice and voles, but a few become good at killing birds. When a cat detects potential prey, his predatory sequence of behaviors starts with silent stalking, watching and waiting for the perfect moment to strike (his rear end might wobble from side to side and his tail might twitch). Then he’ll finally sprint toward the prey and strike it with his front paws. If he’s successful, he’ll deliver a killing bite that all cat species use—he’ll bite the prey at the back of the neck to sever the spinal cord. If your cat likes to watch out the windows, you may have seen him become focused, twitch the end of his tail and move his mouth to make a strange chattering sound. When cats do this, it’s because they’ve detected prey that they’d like to hunt.%&07%%&07%Destructive Scratching%&07%Cats like to scratch. They scratch during play. They scratch while stretching. They scratch to mark territory or as a threatening signal other cats. And because cats’ claws need regular sharpening, cats scratch on things to remove frayed, worn outer claws and expose new, sharper claws. All this scratching can cause a lot of damage to furniture, drapes and carpeting!%&07%%&07%What to Do About Your Cat’s Scratching Habits%&07%The best tactic when dealing with scratching is not to try to stop your cat from scratching, but instead to teach her where and what to scratch. An excellent approach is to provide her with appropriate, cat-attractive surfaces and objects to scratch, such as scratching posts. The following steps will help you encourage your cat to scratch where you want her to:%&07%%&07%• Provide a variety of scratching posts with different qualities and surfaces. Try giving your cat posts made of cardboard, carpeting, wood, sisal and upholstery. Some cats prefer horizontal posts. Others might like vertical posts or slanted posts. Some prefer a vertical grain for raking, while others favor a horizontal grain for picking. Once you figure out your cat’s preference for scratching, provide additional posts of that kind in various locations. Keep in mind that all cats want a sturdy post that won’t shift or collapse when used. Most cats also like a post that’s tall enough that they can stretch fully. (This may be why cats seem to like drapes so much!)%&07%%&07%• Encourage your cat to investigate her posts by scenting them with catnip, hanging toys on them and placing them in areas where she’ll be inclined to climb on them.%&07%%&07%• Discourage inappropriate scratching by removing or covering other desirable objects. Turn speakers toward the wall. Put plastic, double-sided sticky tape, sandpaper or upside-down vinyl carpet runner (knobby parts up) on furniture or on the floor where your cat would stand to scratch your furniture. Place scratching posts next to these objects, as “legal” alternatives.%&07%%&07%• Clip your cat’s nails regularly.%&07%%&07%• Consider putting plastic caps on your cat’s claws so that he’ll do no damage if he scratches on something in your home. These special caps attach to claws with an adhesive. They’re temporary, lasting four to six weeks.%&07%%&07%• If you catch your cat in the act of scratching an inappropriate object, you can try startling him by clapping your hands or squirting him with water. Use this procedure only as a last resort, because your cat may associate you with the startling event (clapping or squirting) and learn to fear you.%&07%%&07%What NOT to Do%&07%%&07%• Do not hold your cat by the scratching post and force her to drag her claws on it. This practice could seriously frighten your cat and teach her to avoid the scratching post completely. She might decide to avoid you, too!%&07%%&07%• Do not throw away a favorite scratching post when it becomes unsightly. Cats prefer shredded and torn objects because they can really get their claws into the material. Used posts will also appeal to your cat because they smell and look familiar to her.%&07%%&07%Should You Declaw Your Cat?%&07%%&07%Some people decide to declaw their cats to prevent or resolve a scratching problem. The ASPCA is strongly opposed to declawing cats, because declawing has not been proven an effective method for improving behavioral issues, including aggression towards people or other cats. It should never be used as a behavioral remedy or as a preventative measure. The only circumstances in which the procedure should be considered are those in which all behavioral and environmental alternatives have been fully explored, have proven to be ineffective, and the cat is at grave risk of euthanasia.%&07%%&07%The term “declaw” is actually a misnomer. It implies that declawing only involves the removal of a cat’s claws. In reality, declawing (or onychectomy) is the amputation of the last digital bone, including the nail bed and claw, on the front of each toe. Cats suffer from significant pain while recovering from this procedure. The surgery introduces the cat to the risk of anesthesia, excessive bleeding and postoperative complications, including infection, and is accompanied by pain that may last from several days to much longer unless appropriate pain control is provided.%&07%%&07%A variety of alternatives exist to manage natural scratching behavior, behavioral issues and to prevent injury from cat scratches. These include having a cat’s nails trimmed regularly in order to blunt the tips, providing scratching pads, posts and other appealing structures for the cat to use and employing behavior modification techniques to induce the cat to use them, using deterrents such as double-sided tape to protect furnishings, and covering the claws with soft temporary. Pet parents should also be familiar with cat behavior and proper handling techniques to avoid being scratched.","cat, aggression, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-photos.appspot.com/o/cat%2F11.cat-aggression.jpg?alt=media&token=7a029b75-2e45-4b69-9ecf-04f6cd7603d7
Litter Box Problems,ASPCA,"At least 10% of all cats develop elimination problems. Some stop using the box altogether. Some only use their boxes for urination or defecation but not for both. Still others eliminate both in and out of their boxes. Elimination problems can develop as a result of conflict between multiple cats in a home, as a result of a dislike for the litter-box type or the litter itself, as a result of a past medical condition, or as a result of the cat deciding she doesn’t like the location or placement of the litter box.%&07%%&07%Once a cat avoids her litter box for whatever reason, her avoidance can become a chronic problem because the cat can develop a surface or location preference for elimination—and this preference might be to your living room rug or your favorite easy chair. The best approach to dealing with these problems is to prevent them before they happen by making your cat’s litter boxes as cat-friendly as possible. See our common litter-box management issues below, and our ways to make litter boxes cat-friendly. It is also important that you pay close attention to your cat’s elimination habits so that you can identify problems in the making. If your cat does eliminate outside her box, you must act quickly to resolve the problem before she develops a strong preference for eliminating on an unacceptable surface or in an unacceptable area.%&07%Litter box use problems in cats can be diverse and complex. Behavioral treatments are often effective, but the treatments must be tailored to the cat’s specific problem. Be certain to read the entire article to help you identify your particular cat’s problem and to familiarize yourself with the different resolution approaches to ensure success with your cat.%&07%Why Do Some Cats Eliminate Outside the Litter Box?%&07%Litter-Box Management Problems%&07%If your cat isn’t comfortable with her litter box or can’t easily access it, she probably won’t use it. The following common litter-box problems might cause her to eliminate outside of her box:%&07%•You haven’t cleaned your cat’s litter box often or thoroughly enough.%&07%•You haven’t provided enough litter boxes for your household. Be sure to have a litter box for each of your cats, as well as one extra.%&07%•Your cat’s litter box is too small for her.%&07%•Your cat can’t easily get to her litter box at all times.%&07%•Your cat’s litter box has a hood or liner that makes her uncomfortable.%&07%•The litter in your cat’s box is too deep. Cats usually prefer one to two inches of litter.%&07%Surface Preference%&07%Some cats develop preferences for eliminating on certain surfaces or textures like carpet, potting soil or bedding.%&07%Litter Preference or Aversion%&07%As predators who hunt at night, cats have sensitive senses of smell and touch to help them navigate through their environment. These sensitivities can also influence a cat’s reaction to her litter. Cats who have grown accustomed to a certain litter might decide that they dislike the smell or feel of a different litter.%&07%Location Preference or Aversion%&07%Like people and dogs, cats develop preferences for where they like to eliminate and may avoid locations they don’t like. This means they might avoid their litter box if it’s in a location they dislike.%&07%Inability to Use the Litter Box%&07%Geriatric cats or cats with physical limitations may have a difficult time using certain types of litter boxes such as top-entry boxes, or litter boxes with high sides.%&07%Negative Litter-Box Association%&07%There are many reasons why a cat who has reliably used her litter box in the past starts to eliminate outside of the box. One common reason is that something happened to upset her while she was using the litter box. If this is the case with your cat, you might notice that she seems hesitant to return to the box. She may enter the box, but then leave very quickly—sometimes before even using the box.%&07%One common cause for this is painful elimination. If your cat had a medical condition that caused her pain when she eliminated, she may have learned to associate the discomfort with using her litter box. Even if your cat’s health has returned to normal, that association may still cause her to avoid her litter box.%&07%Household Stress%&07%Stress can cause litter-box problems. Cats can be stressed by events that their owners may not think of as traumatic. Changes in things that even indirectly affect the cat, like moving, adding new animals or family members to your household—even changing your daily routine—can make your cat feel anxious.%&07%%&07%What to Do If Your Cat Eliminates Outside the Litter Box%&07%Basic Tips for Making Cats Feel Better About Using Their Litter Boxes%&07%•Virtually all cats like clean litter boxes, so scoop and change your cat’s litter at least once a day. Rinse the litter box out completely with baking soda or unscented soap once a week.%&07%•The majority of cats prefer large boxes that they can enter easily. Plastic sweater storage containers make excellent litter boxes.%&07%•Most cats like a shallow bed of litter. Provide one to two inches of litter rather than three to four inches.%&07%•Most cats prefer clumping, unscented litter.%&07%•Your cat may prefer the type of litter she used as a kitten.%&07%•Most cats don’t like box liners or lids on their boxes.%&07%•Cats like their litter boxes located in a quiet but not “cornered” location. They like to be able to see people or other animals approaching, and they like to have multiple escape routes in case they want to leave their boxes quickly.%&07%•Because self-cleaning boxes are generally cleaner than traditional types of litter boxes, many cats accept them readily. However, if you’re using a self-cleaning litter box and your cat starts eliminating outside the box, try switching to a traditional type of litter box.%&07%Resolving a Litter-Box Problem%&07%The first step in resolving elimination outside the litter box is to rule out urine marking and medical problems. Have your cat checked thoroughly by a veterinarian. Once your veterinarian determines that your cat doesn’t have a medical condition or issue, try following these guidelines:%&07%•Provide enough litter boxes. Make sure you have one for each cat in your household, plus one extra. For example, if you have three cats, you’ll need a minimum of four litter boxes.%&07%•Place litter boxes in accessible locations, away from high-traffic areas and away from areas where the cat might feel trapped. If you live in a multistory residence, you may need to provide a litter box on each level. Keep boxes away from busy, loud or intimidating places, like next to your washer and dryer or next to your dog’s food and water bowls, or in areas where there’s a lot of foot traffic.%&07%•Put your cat’s food bowls somewhere other than right next to her litter box.%&07%•Remove covers and liners from all litter boxes.%&07%•Give your cat a choice of litter types. Cats generally prefer clumping litter with a medium to fine texture. Use unscented litter. Offer different types of litter in boxes placed side-by-side to allow your cat to show you her preference.%&07%•Scoop at least once a day. Once a week, clean all litter boxes with warm water and unscented soap, baking soda or no soap, and completely replace the litter. The problem with scented cleaners is that your cat could develop an aversion to the scent.%&07%•Clean accidents thoroughly with an enzymatic cleanser designed to neutralize pet odors. You can find this kind of cleaner at most pet stores.%&07%•If your cat soils in just a few spots, place litter boxes there. If it’s not possible to put a box in a spot where your cat has eliminated, place her food bowl, water bowl, bed or toys in that area to discourage further elimination.%&07%•Make inappropriate elimination areas less appealing. Try putting regular or motion-activated lights in dark areas. You can also make surfaces less pleasant to stand on by placing upside-down carpet runners, tin foil or double-sided sticky tape in the area where your cat has eliminated in the past.%&07%What NOT to Do%&07%Regardless of what you do so solve your cat’s elimination problems, here are a few things to avoid:%&07%•Do not rub your cat’s nose in urine or feces.%&07%•Do not scold your cat and carry or drag her to the litter box.%&07%•Do not confine your cat to a small room with the litter box, for days to weeks or longer, without doing anything else to resolve her elimination problems.%&07%•Do not clean up accidents with an ammonia-based cleanser. Urine contains ammonia, and therefore cleaning with ammonia could attract your cat to the same spot to urinate again. Instead, use a product specifically for cleaning pet accidents.","cat, littering, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-photos.appspot.com/o/cat%2F12.problem-litter.jpg?alt=media&token=7c4f1fdc-da2a-4692-87f5-01b2a4b855d8
Meowing and Yowling,ASPCA,"The cat’s meow is her way of communicating with people. Cats meow for many reasons—to say hello, to ask for things, and to tell us when something’s wrong. Meowing is an interesting vocalization in that adult cats don’t actually meow at each other, just at people. Kittens meow to let their mother know they’re cold or hungry, but once they get a bit older, cats no longer meow to other cats. But they continue to meow to people throughout their lives, probably because meowing gets people to do what they want. Cats also yowl—a sound similar to the meow but more drawn out and melodic. Unlike meowing, adult cats do yowl at one another, specifically during breeding season.%&07%When does meowing become excessive? That’s a tough call to make, as it’s really a personal issue. All cats are going to meow to some extent—this is normal communication behavior. But some cats meow more than their pet parents would like. Bear in mind that some breeds of cats, notably the Siamese, are prone to excessive meowing and yowling.%&07%Why Cats Meow%&07%These are the most common reasons why cats meow:%&07%•To greet people. Your cat can be expected to meow in greeting when you come home, when she meets up with you in the house and when you speak to her.%&07%•To solicit attention. Cats enjoy social contact with people, and some will be quite vocal in their requests for attention. The cat may want to be stroked, played with or simply talked to. Cats who are left alone for long periods of time each day may be more likely to meow for attention.%&07%•To ask for food. Most cats like to eat, and they can be quite demanding around mealtimes. Some cats learn to meow whenever anyone enters the kitchen, just in case food might be forthcoming. Others meow to wake you up to serve them breakfast. Cats also learn to beg for human food by meowing.%&07%•To ask to be let in or out. Meowing is the cat’s primary way to let you know what she wants. If she wants to go outside, she’ll likely learn to meow at the door. Likewise, if she’s outdoors and wants in, she’ll meow to get you to let her back inside. If you’re trying to transition a cat from being indoor-outdoor to living exclusively indoors, you may be in for a period of incessant meowing at doors and windows. This is a difficult change for a cat to make, and it will very likely take weeks or even months for the meowing to stop.%&07%•Elderly cats suffering from mental confusion, or cognitive dysfunction, may meow if they become disoriented—a frequent symptom of this feline version of Alzheimer’s Disease. For more information, please read our article on Behavior Problems in Older Cats.%&07%•To find a mate. Reproductively intact cats are more likely to yowl. Females yowl to advertise their receptivity to males, and males yowl to gain access to females.%&07%Take Your Cat to the Veterinarian%&07%A cat who meows a lot should be checked thoroughly by a veterinarian to ensure a medical condition is not the cause of the cat’s distress. Numerous diseases can cause cats to feel unusually hungry, thirsty, restless or irritable—any of which is likely to prompt meowing. Even if your cat has a history of meowing for food, you should still have her checked by your veterinarian. As cats age, they’re prone to developing an overactive thyroid and kidney disease, and either one may result in excessive meowing.%&07%Helping Your Cat Be Less Vocal%&07%Before you try to curb your cat’s excessive vocalizing, you need to determine the cause. Look at the circumstances around her meowing and make note of what seems to get her to stop. It may help to keep a log book so you can look for any patterns in when she becomes especially vocal. Once you identify when she’s likely to meow excessively, try these suggestions to help her control her vocalizations:%&07%•If your cat meows to say hello, it’s unlikely that you’ll be able to do much to change things—you have an especially vocal cat who is telling you how glad she is to see you!%&07%•If your cat is meowing for attention, teach her that you’ll only pay attention to her when she’s quiet. Resist the urge to shout at her or give her any form of attention, even angry attention. Instead, be patient and wait for a brief moment of silence. Immediately give her the attention she craves. If she starts to meow again, walk away, and only return to her when she’s quiet. If you’re consistent, she will catch on.%&07%•If you believe your cat cries out of loneliness because you spend too much time out of the house, consider having a pet sitter come partway through the day to visit and play with her.%&07%•If your cat meows at you for food, stop feeding her when she cries! Feed her at prescribed times so she learns that it’s futile to ask for food at other times. If that doesn’t work, buy an automatic feeder that you can schedule to open at specific times. At least then she’s more likely to meow at the feeder than at you! This is especially useful if your cat wakes you up in the morning to be fed—she’ll switch from bothering you to sitting and watching the feeder, waiting for it to open.%&07%•If you’ve recently placed your cat on a diet, consult with your veterinarian about high-fiber diet foods or supplements that can help your cat feel satisfied with her reduced intake.%&07%•If your cat isn’t prone to gaining weight, consider leaving dry food out for her all the time so she never has to feel hungry. If you feed a high-fiber diet food, your cat can feel full without taking in too many calories. Check with your veterinarian before trying this.%&07%•If your cat is meowing to get you to let her inside/outside, consider installing a cat door so you don’t have to serve as her butler. The ASPCA recommends that cats be kept exclusively indoors to protect them from danger and disease. If you have a cat who’s accustomed to going outside and you want to keep her in, she’s likely to go through a period of meowing at doors and windows. There’s no easy way to get through this, but as long as she never gets outside again, she will eventually adjust to her life indoors and stop meowing so much. Another option is to build an outdoor cat enclosure so she can spend time outside but remain safe.%&07%•If your female cat isn’t spayed and she periodically meows excessively, she may be in heat at those times. Female cats in heat typically become increasingly affectionate, rub against you more, purr, roll around on the floor—and meow a lot. This lasts four to ten days. An unspayed female cat who isn’t bred by (doesn’t have sex with) a male cat will continue to come into heat every 18 to 24 days throughout the breeding season (roughly February through September in the Northern Hemisphere). Indoor cats may continue to come into heat all year round. The best way to reduce excessive meowing caused by the heat cycle is to have your cat spayed.%&07%•If your male cat isn’t neutered and he periodically meows excessively, he may be hearing or smelling a female cat in heat. He is likely to pace and meow relentlessly throughout the time the female stays in heat. Unless you can completely prevent him from being able to detect females in heat, the best way to reduce excessive meowing in an intact male cat is to have him neutered.%&07%•If your cat is elderly and has just started meowing excessively, make sure to have her evaluated by your veterinarian for medical conditions, sensory deficits and cognitive dysfunction. Medication may alleviate her discomfort.%&07%What NOT to Do%&07%•Do not ignore your cat when she meows. The one exception is if you know for certain that she’s meowing to get you to do something she wants. In every other instance, it’s safest to assume that something’s wrong—she may not have access to her litter box, or her water bowl may be empty, or she may be locked in a closet. Always make sure that her needs are met before assuming that she’s just being demanding by meowing at you.%&07%•Do not scold or hit your cat for meowing too much. While these punishments may send her scurrying at first, they are unlikely to have a lasting effect on her meowing behavior. They may, however, cause her to become fearful of you.%&07%","cat, meowing, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-photos.appspot.com/o/cat%2F13.cat-meow.jpg?alt=media&token=9200919e-ed8d-4d5a-98d0-b2f1808992a5
Older Cats with Behavior Problems,ASPCA,"The Effects of Aging%&07%As they age, cats often suffer a decline in functioning, including their cognitive functioning. It’s estimated that cognitive decline—referred to as feline cognitive dysfunction, or FCD—affects more than 55% of cats aged 11 to 15 years and more than 80% of cats aged 16 to 20 years. Memory, ability to learn, awareness, and sight and hearing perception can all deteriorate in cats affected with FCD. This deterioration can cause disturbances in sleeping patterns, disorientation or reduced activity. It can make cats forget previously learned habits they once knew well, such as the location of the litter box or their food bowls. It can increase their anxiety and tendency to react aggressively. It can also change their social relationships with you and with other pets in your home. Understanding the changes your cat is undergoing can help you compassionately and effectively deal with behavior problems that may arise in her senior years.  %&07%Some effects of aging aren’t related to cognitive dysfunction. Often these effects can contribute to behavior changes that only look like cognitive decline. Be sure to report all changes you see to your cat’s veterinarian. Don’t assume that your cat is “just getting old” and nothing can be done to help her. Many changes in behavior are signs of treatable medical disorders, and there are a variety of therapies that can comfort your cat and ease her symptoms, including any pain she might be experiencing.%&07%Cognitive Dysfunction Checklist%&07%The following behaviors may indicate cognitive dysfunction in your senior cat:%&07%Learning and Memory%&07%•Eliminates outside the litter box%&07%•Eliminates in sleeping areas or by eating areas%&07%•Sometimes seems unable to recognize familiar people and pets%&07%Confusion and Spatial Disorientation%&07%•Gets lost in familiar locations%&07%•Stares or fixates on objects or simply stares into space%&07%•Wanders about aimlessly%&07%•Gets stuck and can’t navigate around or over obstacles%&07%Relationships and Social Behavior%&07%•Less interested in petting, interactions, greeting people or familiar pets, etc.%&07%•Needs constant contact, becomes overdependent and clingy%&07%Activity—Decreased, Apathetic%&07%•Explores less and responds less to things going on around her%&07%•Grooms herself less%&07%•Eats less%&07%Anxiety and Increased Irritability%&07%•Seems restless or agitated%&07%•Vocalizes more and/or in a more urgent tone%&07%•Behaves more irritably in general%&07%Sleep-Wake Cycles and Reversed Day-Night Schedule%&07%•Sleeps restlessly, wakes up during the night%&07%•Sleeps more during the day%&07%•Vocalizes more at night%&07%Ruling Out Other Causes for Your Cat’s Behavior%&07%If your cat shows any of the symptoms or changes listed above, your first step is to take her to the veterinarian to determine whether there is a specific medical cause for her behavior. Any medical or degenerative illness that causes pain, discomfort or decreased mobility—such as arthritis, dental disease, thyroid dysfunction, cancer, impaired sight or hearing, or urinary tract disease—can lead to increased sensitivity and irritability, increased anxiety about being touched or approached, increased aggression (because your cat may choose to threaten and bite rather than move away), decreased responsiveness to your voice, reduced ability to adapt to change, and reduced ability to get to usual elimination areas.%&07%If medical problems are ruled out, and if primary behaviorproblems unrelated to aging are ruled out (for example, problems that started years before your cat began aging), your cat’s behavior may be attributed to the effects of aging on the brain.%&07%Treating Cognitive Dysfunction%&07%If cognitive dysfunction is the only logical explanation for changes in your cat’s behavior, the next step is to seek therapy. Treatment mainly consists of making helpful changes to your cat’s environment and keeping her daily schedule consistent. There are also some medicines that may help cats with FCD, such as selegiline hydrochloride. This drug is currently only licensed for use in dogs with cognitive dysfunction, but some behaviorists and veterinarians have reported improvement in cats as well. Your veterinarian may also consider an anti-anxiety medication.%&07%House Soiling%&07%Inappropriate elimination is a common symptom of FCD. In fact, it’s the most common reason that older cats are seen by behaviorists. Any number of medical problems can contribute to inappropriate elimination, including sensory decline, neuromuscular conditions that affect mobility, brain tumors, kidney dysfunction and endocrine system disorders. In short, any disorder that increases your cat’s frequency of elimination or decreases her bladder or bowel control can cause house soiling. Accordingly, the first step in treating inappropriate elimination in any cat, regardless of age, is to take her to her veterinarian for a thorough examination.%&07%If your cat’s veterinarian rules out medical problems, the following suggestions may help:%&07%•Increase the number of litter boxes available to your cat. Place at least one litter box on every floor of your house in case your cat is having trouble going up or down stairs.%&07%•Place additional litter boxes where they’re easy to find and easy to get into. Cats experiencing FCD may forget the location of their litter box. Make sure you keep the existing boxes in their same places, but put new boxes in obvious areas so that your cat can always find an appropriate place to eliminate.%&07%•Use litter boxes with low sides. Many older cats have trouble or experience pain when attempting to get in or out of a litter box with high sides.%&07%Please see our article, Litter Box Problems, for additional suggestions and detailed information about resolving litter-box issues.  %&07%Confusion and Disorientation%&07%Disorientation is often the first sign that pet parents recognize as cognitive decline in their older cats. It’s estimated that disorientation occurs in at least 40% of cats aged 17 years and older.%&07%Disorientation may be reduced by increasing the predictability of your cat’s environment and schedule. Avoid changes to her food, food placement, litter and litter box placement. Try to keep her daily routine as consistent as possible. If she’s really distressed, it may be best to confine her to a relatively small space, such as one floor of your house or, in advanced cases, one room. Doing this will make it easy for her to find everything she needs.%&07%Restlessness and Waking at Night%&07%A cat’s sleep-wake cycle can be impaired by FCD. However, as with most symptoms of FCD, there are also many alternative reasons for increased nighttime activity. For instance, cats who sleep more during the day can become more restless and active at night. Sensory changes, such as eyesight or hearing loss, can affect your cat’s depth of sleep. An increased need to eliminate combined with a decreased ability to locate or access a litter box can prompt your cat to wake up and wander around. Ask your cat’s veterinarian to do a complete examination to identify medical problems that could cause restlessness, discomfort, or an increased need to eliminate. At the same time, try to reestablish your cat’s normal sleeping and waking hours. It’s best to increase her activity level by engaging her in play during the day and in the evening so she’ll want to sleep at night.%&07%Anxiety can also cause increased restlessness at night. A distinct feature of geriatric anxiety is that it can manifest as nighttime anxiety. It may be anxiety about being separated from family members (who are asleep) or worry about navigating the house in the dark. Your cat may keep you awake by calling, pacing in your room, purring by your head and by pawing at you for attention. FCD anxiety can improve with drug therapy. You can also consult a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB or ACAAB) and your veterinarian, or a veterinary behaviorist (Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Behavior, Dip ACVB) to see if medication may be helpful.%&07%Excessive Vocalization%&07%Older cats may vocalize excessively for a number of reasons, including disorientation, loss of hearing and pain due to one or more medical conditions. (Please see our article, Meowing and Yowling, for more information about excessive vocalizing and how to resolve it.) As with other symptoms of FCD, your first step should be to take your cat to her veterinarian for a thorough examination to rule out or treat any medical problems.%&07%FCD generally increases vocalizations related to anxiety, disorientation and separation distress. Anxious vocalizing is usually a plaintive meow. Your senior cat’s vocalizing can become a problem if she does it too often or at inappropriate times, like when you’re sleeping. Showing your own frustration or punishing your cat for vocalizing can increase her anxiety and aggravate the problem. It’s better to treat increased vocalization by increasing your cat’s activity during the day and gradually reestablishing her proper sleep-wake cycle.%&07%Pheromone or drug therapy may help your cat feel less anxious. You can use feline pheromone sprays or diffusers in areas where your cat normally spends her time. Anti-anxiety medication can also help reduce vocalizations. You can also seek advice from a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB or ACAAB) and your veterinarian, or a veterinary behaviorist (Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Behavior, Dip ACVB).%&07%","cat, older, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-photos.appspot.com/o/cat%2F14.old-cat.jpg?alt=media&token=ad2e08c5-9342-4bdc-ad40-018cba55c95d
Urine Marking in Cats,ASPCA,"The most common behavior problem reported by pet parents of cats is inappropriate elimination. It’s estimated that 10% of all cats will eliminate outside their litter box at some point in their lives. Quite a few of these cats have issues with some characteristic of their litter box (please see our article on Litter Box Problems for more information), but approximately 30% don’t have litter box problems at all. These cats are urine marking, and urine marking isn’t a litter box problem—it’s a communication problem. Urine marking is a form of indirect communication used by cats.%&07%Why Do Cats Urine Mark?%&07%Animal species who live in social groups in which the members depend on each other for survival have sophisticated interpersonal communication. Particularly animals who can cause significant harm to each other—like dogs—have developed a social mechanism for preventing conflict through interpersonal ranking. They are prepared to assume either a leadership or deference position, and they can read another animal’s body language to interpret his intentions and react accordingly. But cats have a somewhat unique social structure in that they do not hunt, eat or sleep in groups like dogs.%&07%Given the opportunity, cats go off on their own when they mature and claim certain areas or territories for themselves. They might share a territory with other cats, but it’s a time-share approach—they avoid each other whenever possible. They haven’t developed a social system or a communication system like dogs. Socially, cats who greet often handle things like two neighbors in an argument—although one might back down if he thinks he might get injured—neither individual will ever perceive himself as having lower status than the other. Cats have no system for working out face-to-face disputes, so face-to-face disputes can be dangerous for them. To avoid disputes, cats communicate indirectly—they leave messages.%&07%Cats have numerous ways to leave messages for each other, and one way is through urine marking. By urine marking, a cat tells other cats of his presence and makes a statement about such things as what piece of property is his, how long ago he was in the area and, over time, when other cats can expect him to return. Cats can even advertise when they are looking for a mate. All this information is available to other cats in the urine. This way, cats rarely have to meet up with each other.%&07%Cats who live in houses might not have to hunt for their food or find a mate, but they still look at their world in the same way as cats who must survive on their own. They can only use the social and communication skills that nature gave them. If their world is predictable, there are no conflicts, they are spayed or neutered and they don’t need a mate, cats have little reason to mark and probably will not. But, if they want a mate or they are distressed about something, they’ll deal with their distress like any cat: they’ll mark their territory. To a cat, marking helps keep unwanted individuals away—whoever and whatever those individuals may be—and it creates an atmosphere of familiarity that makes them feel more secure.%&07%How Can I Tell If My Cat Has a Litter Box Problem or a Communication Problem?%&07%It takes a bit of detective work to determine whether your cat has a litter box problem or is urine marking. Cats who urine mark also use their litter boxes for voiding, so urine in the litter box does not rule out marking outside the box. But urine marking deposits are usually qualitatively different than inappropriate eliminations outside the box.%&07%The following is a list of characteristics that indicate urine marking:%&07%•Urine marks are usually deposited on vertical surfaces. Marking on a vertical surface is known as spraying. When spraying, a cat usually backs up to a vertical object like the side of a chair, a wall or a stereo speaker, stands with his body erect and his tail extended straight up in the air, and sprays urine onto the surface. Often his tail and sometimes his entire body twitch while he’s spraying.%&07%•Urine mark deposits often have less volume than voided deposits. The amount of urine a cat sprays when he’s urine marking is usually less than the amount he would void during regular elimination in his box.%&07%•The urine smells pungent. The reason cats can learn so much from the urine mark of another cat is that a urine mark isn’t just urine. It also contains extra communication chemicals. Those chemicals smell pungent to people.%&07%There are also certain characteristics of a cat or a household that can contribute to urine marking:%&07%•The cat is an unneutered male. Although female cats as well as neutered and spayed cats can urine mark, unneutered males have more reason to do so. One function of urine marking is to advertise reproductive availability, so unneutered males may urine mark to let females know they are available.%&07%•There are multiple cats in the household. The more cats who live in a home, the more likely it is that at least one of them will urine mark. Houses that have more than 10 cats invariably have urine marking problems.%&07%•There has been a change in the household in some way. Cats don’t like change. When things change, cats can become stressed. Urine marking behavior can be triggered by someone moving in, moving out, getting a dog, cat or other animal, building a room, remodeling the kitchen, changing work hours, going to stay in the hospital, having a baby, even buying a new coat or bringing home groceries in an unusually large paper bag. One of the ways cats deal with this stress is by marking their territory. They might do it to preempt a problem by leaving a message that this place is theirs, or they might do it to comfort themselves with their own familiar scent.%&07%•There is conflict between cats. The conflict can be between cats in the house or between the housecat and other cats he sees outside. Cats mark in response to conflict with other cats for the same reasons they mark in response to household changes. Cat-to-cat conflict is one of the most common reasons for urine marking, and it’s usually anxiety based rather than intolerance based. A cat doesn’t necessarily get angry because another cat has the audacity to come into his territory. Rather, he gets upset because he doesn’t have the social skills to deal with the intrusion. If a cat is prevented from avoiding the other cat, he’ll become increasingly stressed and mark often.%&07%Treating Urine Marking in Intact Cats%&07%Here are a few things you can do to remedy the urine marking behavior of an intact cat:%&07%•Neuter or spay your cat. Although marking isn’t limited to advertisement for a mate, advertisement is one reason that cats mark. Neutering or spaying is a proven treatment for cats who mark as a reproductive advertisement.%&07%•Close windows, blinds and doors. Prevent your indoor cat from seeing other neighborhood cats.%&07%•Attach a motion-detection device to your lawn sprinkler. Set the sprinkler by windows to deter the presence of neighborhood cats.%&07%Treating Urine Marking Caused by Conflict in a Multi-Cat Household%&07%The first step in fixing any elimination problem is to rule out medical problems. Although there is no medical problem that contributes specifically to urine marking, physical problems can create increased anxiety in a cat, which can contribute to marking. Once your veterinarian has determined that your cat doesn’t have a medical condition or issue, consider the following guidelines:%&07%•Determine which cat is marking. If you have multiple cats and aren’t sure which cat is marking, speak with your veterinarian about giving fluorescein, a harmless dye, to one of your cats. Although the dye does not usually stain furniture or walls, it causes urine to glow blue under ultraviolet light for about 24 hours. If you can’t get or use fluorescein, you can temporarily confine your cats, one at a time, to determine which one is marking.%&07%•Provide enough litter boxes. Although marking is not an elimination problem, if there are too few litter boxes for all the cats, conflict will arise over litter box use and can contribute to marking. Make sure you have one box for each cat in your house, plus one extra. For example, if you have three cats, you’ll need a minimum of four litter boxes. Place additional boxes in locations where the anxious (marking) cat spends the majority of his time.%&07%•Place litter boxes in low-traffic areas with at least two exit routes. Again, the object is to avoid conflict between cats. In addition, if you have a dog, keep the boxes away from your dog’s food and water bowls. Cats can mark in response to dogs as well as other cats.%&07%•Scoop at least once a day. In addition to scooping the litter box daily, clean all litter boxes with warm water and unscented soap, or baking soda and no soap, and completely replace the litter once a week. This helps reduce the presence of any offending “other cat” scent.%&07%•Provide multiple perching areas. Cats need their own space. Conflict can often be reduced simply by providing more perching areas so that all cats can have a place to rest well away from the others. Creating space can be as easy as clearing windowsills or shelves, or purchasing multipitch cat trees.%&07%•Distribute resources. Provide multiple sources of food, water, scratching posts and toys so that each cat can make use of them without coming into contact or having a conflict with one of the other cats.%&07%•Play with your cats. Increased play with individual cats in different areas of your home can sometimes reduce conflict. Encourage play with toys that dangle on strings suspended from sticks. Attempts to encourage mutual play can sometimes help reduce conflict, but it might simply increase conflict if your cats react poorly at the very sight of each other. Please see our article on Aggression Between Cats in Your Household for more information on reducing conflict between cats.%&07%•Clean accidents thoroughly with an enzymatic cleanser designed to neutralize pet odors. You can find this kind of cleaner at most pet stores.%&07%•Use a synthetic cat pheromone in areas where the cat has marked. Products like this deliver a synthetic pheromone that has been shown to have some effect in relieving stress in cats. Deliver the pheromone through a diffuser plugged in close to where your cat has seen the outdoor cats. This type of product is typically available as a spray or through a diffuser, and can be found in many pet stores and online.%&07%•Use medications. Because marking is often a sign of stress or anxiety, medication can provide additional treatment help. If you’re considering behavioral medication, be certain to first consult with your veterinarian, a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB or ACAAB) or a Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Behavior (Dip ACVB). These animal behavior experts can evaluate your cat’s behavior problem and help you develop a treatment plan, give you advice on suitable medications and work with your veterinarian to maximize the success of your cat’s treatment program.%&07%Treating Urine Marking Caused by Conflict with Outdoor Cats%&07%You can try the following recommendations to remedy urine marking behavior caused by conflict with an outdoor cat:%&07%•Close windows, blinds and doors. Prevent your indoor cat from seeing other neighborhood cats.%&07%•Attach a motion-detection device to your lawn sprinkler. Set the sprinkler by windows to deter the presence of neighborhood cats.%&07%•If your cat is intact, neuter him or spay her.%&07%•Use a synthetic cat pheromone in areas where the cat has marked.

Always consult with your veterinarian, a Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist (CAAB or ACAAB) or a veterinary behaviorist (Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Behavior, Dip ACVB) before giving your cat any type of medication for a behavior problem.%&07%What NOT to Do%&07%Here are a few things to avoid when treating urine marking:%&07%•Do not rub your cat’s nose in his urine.%&07%•Do not throw things at your cat.%&07%•Do not clean up accidents with an ammonia-based cleanser. Urine contains ammonia, so cleaning with ammonia can attract your cat that same spot to urinate again.%&07%","cat, urine marking, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-photos.appspot.com/o/cat%2F15.cat-urine.jpg?alt=media&token=bcbcf4bb-159a-4ee1-941f-a01fb95e56cb
Cancer in cat,ASPCA,"Cancer is a class of diseases in which cells grow uncontrollably, invade surrounding tissue and may spread to other areas of the body. As with people, cats can get various kinds of cancer. The disease can be localized (confined to one area, like a tumor) or generalized (spread throughout the body).%&07%Causes of Cancer%&07%Cancer is a “multifactorial” disease, which means it has no known single cause. However, we do know that both hereditary and environmental factors can lead to the development of cancer in cats.%&07%%&07%•Squamous cell carcinoma of the ear, eyelid or nose is a skin cancer caused by repeated exposure to the sun. White, or light colored, cats are more susceptible to squamous cell carcinoma.%&07%•Lymphosarcoma or lymphoma (LSA), is one of the most common type of cancer in cats. Some reports estimate that 30% of all reported cat cancers are due to LSA.  Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is linked to most forms of LSA except for the gastrointestinal (GI) form. FeLV is a transmittable retrovirus that can be passed in utero as well as through saliva and direct contact. Primarily a disease in younger cats, the virus doesn’t always manifest symptoms, so it is important to have your cat tested regularly to prevent transmission and progression. There is a vaccine available for FeLV that your veterinarian can discuss with you based on your cat’s lifestyle and risk of exposure to FeLV.%&07%The GI form of LSA (the most common form) can cause a large mass in the stomach or intestine or diffuse infiltration throughout the intestinal tract.%&07%%&07%It is important to take your cat to your veterinarian if any evidence of disease is noted. LSA is not curable, however, most cats respond well to treatment.%&07%Cancer Symptoms%&07%Symptoms of cancer in cats may include:%&07%•Lumps (which are not always malignant, but are always worth having a veterinarian examine)%&07%•Swelling%&07%•Persistent sores or skin infections%&07%•Abnormal discharge from any part of the body%&07%•Bad breath%&07%•Listlessness, lethargy or other marked change in behavior%&07%•Weight loss%&07%•Sudden lameness%&07%•Diarrhea or vomiting%&07%•Scaly and/or red skin patches%&07%•Decreased or loss of appetite%&07%•Difficulty breathing, urinating or defecating%&07%•Change in behavior%&07%Diagnosing Cancer in Cats%&07%•If a lump is present, the first step is typically a needle biopsy, which removes a very small tissue sample for microscopic examination of cells. Alternately, surgery may be performed to remove all or part of the lump for diagnosis by a pathologist.%&07%•Radiographs, ultrasound, blood evaluation and other diagnostic tests may also be helpful in determining if cancer is present or if it has spread.%&07%Cats More Prone to Cancer%&07%•Though cancer can be diagnosed in cats of all ages and breeds, it is much more common in older cats.%&07%•Certain breeds are prone to specific cancers, but cats with white ears and heads are particularly susceptible to skin cancer.%&07%Ask your vet if your cat falls into specific at-risk categories.%&07%Cancer Prevention%&07%•Keeping your cat indoors will protect her from certain skin cancers caused by repeated sun exposure and sunburn.%&07%•Breast cancer is a common cancer for cats, but it can be avoided by having your cat spayed before her first heat cycle.%&07%Cancer Treatments%&07%•Treatment options vary and depend on the type and stage of cancer.%&07%•Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapy or a combination of therapies. Success of treatment depends on the form and extent of the cancer and the aggressiveness of the therapy. Of course, early detection is best.%&07%•Some cat owners opt for no treatment of the cancer, in which case palliative care, including pain relief, should be considered. Regardless of how you proceed after a diagnosis of cancer in your pet, it is very important to consider his quality of life when making future decisions.%&07%•Some cancers can be cured, and almost all patients can receive at least some benefit from treatment. Please note that if your cat’s cancer is not curable, there are still many things you can do to make your pet feel better. Don’t hesitate to talk to your vet about your options. And remember good nutrition and loving care can greatly enhance your cat’s quality of life.%&07%When to See Your Vet%&07%Contact your veterinarian immediately if your cat shows any of the clinical signs mentioned on the list above.

Diabetes in cat,ASPCA,"Diabetes in cats is a complex disease caused by either a lack of the hormone insulin or an inadequate response to insulin. After a cat eats, her digestive system breaks food into various components, including glucose—which is carried into her cells by insulin. When a cat does not produce insulin or cannot utilize it normally, her blood sugar levels elevate. The result is hyperglycemia, which, if left untreated, can cause many complicated health problems for a cat.%&07%It is important to understand that diabetes is considered a manageable disorder—and many diabetic cats can lead happy, healthy lives. Some may even go into remission!%&07%Diabetes can be classified as:%&07%•Type I (lack of insulin production)%&07%•Type II (impaired insulin production along with an inadequate response to the hormone).%&07%Cats with type II diabetes can progress to type I diabetes. In fact, by the time most cats are diagnosed with diabetes, they are identified as having the type I disorder. These cats require insulin therapy for survival. Cats with type II disease may respond to other forms of therapy.%&07%Diabetes Symptoms in Cats%&07%The following are signs that your cat may be diabetic:%&07%•Change in appetite (either increased or decreased)%&07%•Weight loss%&07%•Excessive thirst/increase in water consumption%&07%•Increased urination%&07%•Urinating in areas other than litter box%&07%•Unusually sweet-smelling breath%&07%•Lethargy%&07%•Dehydration%&07%•Unkempt hair coat%&07%•Urinary tract infection%&07%Causes of Diabetes%&07%The exact cause of diabetes is unknown. Genetics, pancreatic disease, certain medications and abnormal protein deposits in the pancreas can play a role in causing this disorder.%&07%The most important factors in the development of diabetes seem to be obesity, gender (male cats are more commonly afflicted than females) and age.%&07%Diagnosing Diabetes%&07%To properly diagnose diabetes, your veterinarian will collect information about clinical signs, perform a physical examination and check blood work and urinalysis.%&07%Treating Diabetes%&07%•Every diabetic cat is an individual and will respond differently to therapy. Diabetes treatment is based on how severe the signs of disease are and whether there are any other health issues that could complicate therapy.%&07%•Some cats are seriously ill when first diagnosed and require intensive hospitalized care for several days to regulate their blood sugar levels.%&07%•Cats who are more stable when first diagnosed may respond to oral medication or a high-fiber diet.%&07%•For most cats, insulin injections are necessary for adequate regulation of blood glucose. Once your pet’s individual insulin treatment is established, typically based on weight, you will be shown how to give him his insulin injections at home.%&07%•Your vet may also show you how to perform glucose tests at home. Other routine blood work may also be necessary.%&07%As your veterinarian will explain, it’s important to always give your cat insulin at the same time every day and feed her regular meals in conjunction with her medication; this allows increased nutrients in the blood to coincide with peak insulin level. This will lessen the chance that her sugar levels will swing either too high or too low. You can work with your vet to create a feeding schedule around your pet’s medication time. It is also important to avoid feeding your diabetic cat treats that are high in glucose.%&07%Diabetes Prevention%&07%A proper diet and regular exercise can go a long way to avoid the development of feline diabetes. Aside from other negative effects, obesity is known to contribute to insulin resistance.%&07%When to See Your Vet%&07%If your cat is showing any abnormal clinical signs as listed above, make an appointment to see your veterinarian immediately. If a diabetic cat is not treated, he can develop kidney disease, neurological disorders or other metabolic diseases.

Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV),ASPCA,"Cats infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) may not show symptoms until years after the initial infection occurred. Although the virus is slow-acting, a cat’s immune system is severely weakened once the disease takes hold. This makes the cat susceptible to various secondary infections. Infected cats receiving supportive medical care and kept in a stress-free, indoor environment can live relatively comfortable lives for months to years before the disease reaches its chronic stages.%&07%An FIV-infected cat may not show any symptoms for years. Once symptoms do develop, however, they may continually progress—or a cat may show signs of sickness interspersed with health for years. If your cat is demonstrating any of the following symptoms, please have examined by your veterinarian:%&07%•Enlarged lymph nodes%&07%•Fever%&07%•Anemia%&07%•Weight loss%&07%•Disheveled coat%&07%•Poor appetite%&07%•Diarrhea%&07%•Abnormal appearance or inflammation of the eye (conjunctivitis)%&07%•Inflammation of the gums (gingivitis)%&07%•Inflammation of the mouth (stomatitis)%&07%•Dental disease%&07%•Skin redness or hair loss%&07%•Wounds that don’t heal%&07%•Sneezing%&07%•Discharge from eyes or nose%&07%•Frequent urination, straining to urinate or urinating outside of litter box%&07%•Behavior change%&07%FIV Transmission%&07%•FIV is mainly passed from cat to cat through deep bite wounds, the kind that usually occur outdoors during aggressive fights and territorial disputes—a perfect reason to keep your cat inside.%&07%•Another, less common mode of transmission is from an FIV-infected mother cat to her kitten. FIV does not seem to be commonly spread through sharing food bowls and litter boxes, social grooming, sneezing and other casual modes of contact.%&07%•Although any feline is susceptible, free-roaming, outdoor intact male cats who fight most frequently contract the disease. Cats who live indoors are the least likely to be infected.%&07%Please note:  FIV cannot be transmitted from cat to human, only from cat to cat.%&07%Preventing FIV%&07%•The best way to prevent your cat from contracting the virus is to keep him indoors, avoiding any chance of contact with infected felines.%&07%•If you walk your cat, keep him on a leash when outdoors.%&07%•If your cat is going to be spending any time in a cattery or in a home with other felines, make sure all cats have tested negative for FIV.%&07%•Any recently adopted cat should be tested for FIV prior to entering your home.%&07%•You may also want to speak to your veterinarian about the FIV vaccine and if it is appropriate for your cat.%&07%When to See Your Vet%&07%If you suspect your cat has FIV, have him examined and tested by your veterinarian right away. During your visit, be ready to describe any symptoms that you have detected, no matter how minute they seem. Also make sure to keep your cat indoors, away from other felines who might possibly be infected or whom he could infect, until you have a diagnosis.%&07%Without proper treatment, the secondary infections that can occur as a consequence of FIV can progress to life-threatening conditions. Additionally, cats with FIV can develop various forms of cancer, blood diseases or kidney failure, which will ultimately claim the cat’s life.%&07%Diagnosing FIV%&07%•FIV infection is routinely diagnosed by blood testing.%&07%•The FIV status of every cat should be known.%&07%•The most common type of test looks for the presence of antibodies to the virus in the blood. No test is 100% accurate all of the time, and your veterinarian will interpret the test result and determine whether further testing is needed to confirm either a positive or negative test result. Once a cat is determined to be FIV-positive, that cat is capable of transmitting the disease to other cats.%&07%•Since it is possible for an infected mother cat to transfer FIV antibodies to her kittens, these kittens may test positive from their mother’s antibodies until they have cleared them from their systems, which happens by six months of age. Kittens who test positive for FIV antibodies when they’re younger than six months should undergo antibody tests again at a later date to see if they are infected.%&07%FIV Treatment%&07%Unfortunately, there is no specific antiviral treatment for FIV. Cats can carry the virus for a long time before symptoms appear. Therefore, treatment focuses mainly on extending the asymptomatic period or, if symptoms have set in, on easing the secondary effects of the virus. Your veterinarian may prescribe some of the following treatments:%&07%•Medication for secondary infections%&07%•Healthy, palatable diet to encourage good nutrition%&07%•Fluid and electrolyte replacement therapy%&07%•Anti-inflammatory drugs%&07%•Immune-enhancing drugs%&07%•Parasite control%&07%Caring for an FIV-Infected Cat%&07%•Keep your cat indoors. This will protect him from contact with disease-causing agents to which he may be susceptible. By bringing your cat indoors, you’re also protecting the uninfected cats in your community.%&07%•Watch for changes—even seemingly minor—in your cat’s health and behavior. Immediately report any health concerns to your vet.%&07%•Bring your cat to your vet at least twice per year for a wellness checkup, blood count and urine analysis.%&07%•Feed your cat nutritionally balanced food—no raw food diets, please, as bacteria and parasites in uncooked meat and eggs can be dangerous to immunocompromised pets.%&07%•Be sure your cat is spayed or neutered.%&07%","cat, diseases",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-photos.appspot.com/o/cat%2F18.cat-FIV.jpg?alt=media&token=89eeb542-1b59-4ec0-a9ba-4dc8301bb370
Feline Leukemia Virus (FelV),ASPCA,"First discovered in the 1960s, feline leukemia virus is a transmittable RNA retrovirus that can severely inhibit a cat’s immune system. It is one of the most commonly diagnosed causes of disease and death in domestic cats. Because the virus doesn’t always manifest symptoms right away, any new cat entering a household—and any sick cat—should be tested for FeLV. %&07%FeLV weakens an animal’s immune system and predisposes cats to a variety of infections and diseases, including anemia, kidney disease and lymphosarcoma, a highly malignant and fatal cancer of the lymph system.%&07%Young kittens and cats less than one year of age are most susceptible to the virus. Cats living with an infected cat,  allowed outdoors where they may be bitten by an infected cat, and kittens  born to a mother who is FeLV positive are most at risk for infection.%&07%•The FeLV virus is shed in many bodily fluids, including saliva, nasal secretions, urine, feces and blood. %&07%•FeLV is most commonly transmitted through direct contact, mutual grooming and through sharing litter boxes, food and water bowls. %&07%•It can also be passed in utero or through mother’s milk. %&07%•Infected outdoor cats fighting with other cats can transmit the disease through bites and scratches. %&07%Healthy cats over three months of age and vaccinated for FeLV are highly unlikely to contract the virus from another cat. %&07%Signs of FeLV%&07%Cats can be infected and show no signs. Others may exhibit:%&07%•Loss of appetite and weight loss%&07%•Pale or inflamed gums%&07%•Poor coat condition%&07%•Abcesses%&07%•Fever%&07%•Upper respiratory infections%&07%•Diarrhea and vomiting%&07%•Seizures%&07%•Changes in behavior%&07%•Vision or other eye problems%&07%•Enlarged lymph nodes%&07%•Reproductive problems (in females)%&07%•Jaundice%&07%•Chronic skin disease%&07%•Respiratory distress%&07%•Lethargy%&07%Preventing FelV%&07%•There is a vaccine available for cats who are at risk of contracting FeLV. Like all vaccines, there are risks involved in vaccination, and the vaccine is not a 100% guarantee against infection. Your veterinarian can best evaluate whether this vaccine is right for your cat.%&07%•As with any infectious disease, the best prevention is eliminating sources of exposure. Routine FeLV testing and keeping your cat indoors and away from cats whose FeLV status is not known remain the best way to prevent your cat from becoming infected.%&07%Diagnosing FelV%&07%There are several types of tests available to diagnose FeLV.%&07%•Most veterinarians and shelter professionals use the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test, which detects antigen to the FELV virus in the bloodstream.%&07%•Other tests like the IFA (indirect fluorescent antibody) test or PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test are recommended to confirm positive ELISA test results.%&07%Caring for a Cat with FelV%&07%•Feed your cat a nutritionally balanced diet, one free of raw meat, eggs and unpasteurized dairy products, which can harbor bacteria and parasites and lead to infection.%&07%•Provide a quiet place for your cat to rest indoors and away from other cats who could promote disease.%&07%•Bring your cat to the vet every six months—at the very least—for a wellness checkup and blood tests.%&07%•During the early stages of infection, a cat may not show any clinical signs, but he can still pass the virus to other cats. It’s not advisable to introduce a new uninfected cat into the household, even one who has been properly vaccinated against FeLV. Those living in close quarters with infected cats are most at risk for infection, and should be tested for the virus and, if negative, be housed separately.%&07%•FeLV is contagious to other cats, but not to humans or other species. Other cats in the house can acquire the virus from an infected cat. Though the virus doesn’t live long outside of the body, and is easily inactivated with common disinfectants, it can be passed through mutual grooming, shared food and water as well as common litter boxes.%&07%•Sadly there is no cure for FeLV, and it is estimated that less than 20% of clinically infected cats survive more than three years of active infection. In the case of those cats who develop cancer, chemotherapy can help prolong life, but treatment often focuses on providing the best quality of life. %&07%","cat, diseases",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-photos.appspot.com/o/cat%2F19.cat-FELV.png?alt=media&token=54fcb114-bf30-4c20-a46b-f492de0949e8
Heartworm in cat,ASPCA,"Spread by infected mosquitoes, heartworm is increasingly being recognized as an underlying cause of health problems in domestic cats. Cats are an atypical host for heartworms. Despite its name, heartworm primarily causes lung disease in cats. It is an important concern for any cat owner living in areas densely populated by mosquitoes, and prevention should be discussed with a veterinarian.%&07%You may have thought heartworm disease only affects dogs, and it’s true that the infection is less common in cats. The cat is not a natural host for the heartworm parasite, Dirofilaria immitis, and so the heartworm is not likely to complete its entire life cycle. That means that fewer and smaller worms survive, and many do not reach a cat’s heart. The worms that do survive—and the resulting immune reaction that the cat’s body sets up to kill the developing worms—can cause severe health problems.%&07%Causes and Signs of Heartworm Disease%&07%When a mosquito carrying the heartworm parasite, Dirofilaria immitis, bites a cat, larvae are transmitted into the bloodstream. The larvae migrate toward the heart over a period of around four to six months, maturing as they go, then settle in the heart, pulmonary arteries and blood vessels of the lungs. Because a domestic cat is not a natural host for the heartworm parasite, many of the worms die. These—along with the living worms—cause severe inflammatory and immune responses in an infected cat.  %&07%Cats of all ages, living in any region, can contract heartworm, but the disease is more prevalent in felines who live in areas densely populated by mosquitoes. Outdoor cats are at greater risk because of increased exposure to mosquitoes. However, indoor cats are also susceptible to mosquito bites, so it’s smart to discuss prevention with your vet. The heartworm infection can be especially life-threatening to kittens and older cats.%&07%The following signs may indicate that your cat has been infected:%&07%•Persistent cough%&07%•Breathing difficulties (panting, wheezing, rapid or open-mouthed breathing)%&07%•Depression%&07%•Loss of appetite%&07%•Weight loss%&07%•Sporadic vomiting%&07%•Lethargy%&07%•Sudden death%&07%Breathing difficulties that occur in the first stage of heartworm disease, caused by worms newly arriving in the heart and lungs, were likely previously diagnosed as feline asthma or bronchitis. However, these breathing problems are now thought to have actually been due to what is now called heartworm-associated respiratory disease (HARD).%&07%Heartworm Prevention%&07%•There are several FDA-approved medications available that reliably prevent feline heartworm infection. Check with your vet and please remember, it’s recommended that cats are screened for heartworm infection with blood tests before being given any type of preventative medication. %&07%•It’s also a good idea to limit your cat’s exposure to mosquito-infested areas and bring her in for preventative screenings during vet visits.%&07%•Regular checkups are key to detecting early infections and can give your cat a good chance at recovery.%&07% Diagnosing Heartworm Disease%&07%%&07%Heartworm disease is not as easily diagnosed in cats as it is in dogs. %&07%•Routine testing requires a combination of blood tests. %&07%•When cats show signs of respiratory difficulty and heartworm is suspected, diagnosis is usually based on a cat’s history, physical examination, radiographs, echocardiogram and blood tests.%&07%Treating Heartworm Disease%&07%There are currently no products in the United States approved for treating feline heartworm infection. The good news is that many heartworm-infected cats are able to fight the infection themselves, and can be monitored with radiographs every few months, while waiting out the worms’ lifespan. If an infected cat shows symptoms of lung disease, the cat can be given a cortisone-like medication as needed. Medication can also be given to help control coughing and vomiting.%&07%Although some cats are able to fight the infection on their own, the following can occur if heartworms are not monitored and treated:%&07%•Damage to walls of heart%&07%•Damage to pulmonary blood vessels%&07%•Possible obstruction of blood flow through pulmonary arteries%&07%•Impaired breathing%&07%•Heart and lung failure%&07%•Kidney and liver damage%&07%•Sudden death%&07%","cat, diseases",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-photos.appspot.com/o/cat%2F20.cat-heartworm.jpg?alt=media&token=1e6173f2-3c3a-4aad-9277-b0d53c9b32fe
High-Rise Syndrome in cat,ASPCA,"Many pet parents eagerly open their windows to enjoy the weather during the summer months. Unfortunately, unscreened windows pose a real danger to cats, who fall out of them so often that the veterinary profession has a name for the complaint—High-Rise Syndrome. Falls can result in shattered jaws, punctured lungs, broken limbs and pelvises—and even death.%&07%•Cats have excellent survival instincts, and they don’t deliberately “jump” from high places that would be dangerous. Most cats fall accidentally from high-rise windows, terraces or fire escapes.%&07%•Cats have an incredible ability to focus their attention on whatever interests them. A bird or other animal attraction can be distracting enough to cause them to lose their balance and fall.%&07%•Because cats have little fear of heights and enjoy perching in high places, pet owners often assume that they can take care of themselves. Although cats can cling to the bark of trees with their claws, other surfaces are much more difficult, such as window ledges, concrete or brick surfaces.%&07%•When cats fall from high places, they don’t land squarely on their feet. Instead, they land with their feet slightly splayed apart, which can cause severe head and pelvis injuries.%&07%•It is a misconception that cats won’t be injured if they fall from one- or two-story buildings. They may actually be at greater risk for injury when falling shorter distances than by falling from mid-range or higher altitudes. Shorter distances do not give them enough time to adjust their body posture to fall correctly.%&07%•When cats fall from high-rise buildings, they may end up on sidewalks or streets that are dangerous and unfamiliar to them. Never assume that the animal has not survived the fall; immediately rush the animal to the nearest animal hospital or to your veterinarian.%&07%•There is a 90% survival rate for cats who are high-rise victims if they receive immediate and proper medical attention.%&07%Preventing High-Rise Syndrome%&07%To keep your cat safe during the summer, take the following precautions:%&07%•Install snug and sturdy screens in all your windows.%&07%•If you have adjustable screens, please make sure that they are tightly wedged into window frames.%&07%•Note that cats can slip through childproof window guards—these don’t provide adequate protection!%&07%•Cats have excellent survival instincts, and they don’t deliberately “jump” from high places that would be dangerous.

Rabies in cat,ASPCA,"Rabies is a viral disease that affects the brain and spinal cord of all mammals, including cats, dogs and humans. This preventable disease has been reported in every state except Hawaii. There’s good reason that the very word “rabies” evokes fear in people—once symptoms appear, rabies is close to 100% fatal.%&07%Rabies Transmission%&07%There are several reported routes of transmission of the rabies virus.%&07%•Rabies is most often transmitted through a bite from an infected animal.%&07%•Less frequently, it can be passed on when the saliva of an infected animal enters another animal’s body through mucous membranes or an open, fresh wound.%&07%•The risk for contracting rabies runs highest if your cat is exposed to wild animals. Outbreaks can occur in populations of wild animals (most often raccoons, bats, skunks and foxes in this country) or in areas where there are significant numbers of unvaccinated, free-roaming dogs and cats.%&07%•In the United States, rabies is reported in cats more than in any other domestic species.%&07%•Unvaccinated cats who are allowed to roam outdoors are at the highest risk for rabies infection.%&07%•Feral cat populations remain a reservoir host for the rabies virus.%&07%Rabies Prevention%&07%•Vaccination is the key—and in many areas of the country, such as New York City, it's the law.%&07%•Some local ordinances require lengthy quarantines—or euthanasia—of pets who have bitten someone if their owners do not have proof of current vaccination.%&07%•Vaccinating your cat doesn't just protect her from rabies—it also protects your cat if she bites someone.%&07%•In municipalities where rabies vaccinations for cats are not required, the decision to vaccinate is best left to the judgment of the veterinarian and the cat guardian because some cats experience serious side effects to the rabies vaccine.%&07%•The vaccine should definitely be administered if your cat spends any time outdoors (ASPCA experts recommend keeping pet cats indoors).%&07%Symptoms of Rabies%&07%•Animals will not show signs immediately following exposure to a rabid animal. Symptoms can be varied and can take months to develop. Classic signs of rabies in cats include:%&07%•Changes in behavior (including aggression, restlessness and lethargy),%&07%•Increased vocalization%&07%•Loss of appetite%&07%•Weakness%&07%•Disorientation%&07%•Paralysis%&07%•Seizures%&07%•Sudden death%&07%Diagnosing Rabies%&07%•There is no accurate test to diagnose rabies in live animals.%&07%•The direct fluorescent antibody test is the most accurate test for diagnosis, but it can only be performed after the death of the animal.%&07%•The rabies virus can incubate in a cat’s body anywhere from just one week to more than a year before the virus appears in the saliva and the cat is capable of transmitting the disease.%&07%•When the animal becomes infectious, symptoms appear quickly.  It is possible for a cat, or dog, to shed the virus for several days before clinical signs appear.%&07%•There is no treatment or cure for rabies once symptoms appear. The disease results in fatality.%&07%When to See the Vet%&07%•When Your Cat Interacts With a Rabid Animal%&07%•Call your veterinarian for an immediate appointment!%&07%•Contact local animal control officers if the animal who bit your pet is still at large; they will be best able to safely apprehend and remove the animal from the environment.%&07%•A cat who is up to date with his vaccinations and who has been bitten by a possibly rabid animal should also be given a rabies booster vaccine immediately and kept under observation for 45 days.%&07%•If you think you’ve been bitten by a rabid animal, see your doctor immediately!%&07%Note: Do not attempt to handle or capture a wild animal who is acting strangely (i.e., a nocturnal animal who is out during the day, an animal who acts unusually tame).

Ringworm in cat,ASPCA,"Although the name suggests otherwise, ringworm isn’t caused by a worm at all—but a fungus that can infect the skin, hair and nails. Not uncommon in cats, this highly contagious disease can lead to patchy, circular areas of hair loss with central red rings. Also known as dermatophytosis, ringworm often spreads to other pets in the household—and to humans, too.%&07%Ringworm Symptoms%&07%Classic symptoms of ringworm in cats include:%&07%•Skin lesions that typically appear on the head, ears and forelimbs.%&07%•Ringworm can cause flaky bald patches that sometimes look red in the center.%&07%•In mild cases, there may be localized areas of redness or simply dandruff, while more severe infections can spread over a cat’s entire body.%&07%•It’s also possible for a pet to carry ringworm spores and not show any symptoms whatsoever.%&07%Ringworm Transmission%&07%A cat can get ringworm directly through contact with an infected animal—or indirectly through contact with bedding, dishes and other materials that have been contaminated with the skin cells or hairs of infected animals. Ringworm spores are notoriously hardy and can survive in the environment for more than a year!%&07%•Any cat can develop ringworm, but kittens less than a year old and geriatric cats are most prone to infection.%&07%•Long-haired cats and those who are immunocompromised are also more susceptible.%&07%•Ringworm can quickly spread in shelters or other crowded environments.%&07%•Warm and humid conditions tend to promote ringworm infections.%&07%Diagnosing Ringworm%&07%Because infection can potentially spread over a cat’s body, it is important that you see your vet for an accurate diagnosis if you suspect your pet has ringworm. And because the infection can easily spread to you and other animals in the household, it’s a smart idea to immediately quarantine your cat until a veterinarian can confirm a diagnosis. You should also thoroughly wash your hands after you touch your cat.%&07%•Since some cats show few or no symptoms, a diagnosis of ringworm is rarely made just by looking at the skin.%&07%•A veterinarian may use an ultraviolet light to diagnose ringworm, or may examine a fungal culture taken from a cat’s hair or skin cells.%&07%•Skin biopsy and microscopic exam are sometimes also performed.%&07%Treating Ringworm%&07%Treatment of ringworm depends on the severity of the infection.%&07%•A veterinarian may prescribe a shampoo or ointment that contains a special medication to kill the fungus.%&07%•In some cases, oral medications are necessary.%&07%•To ensure that you’ve eradicated this resistant and hardy fungus, treatment may have to be given for several months or more and fungal cultures rechecked periodically.%&07%•It’s also important to treat the cat’s environment to prevent infection from recurring.%&07%If your veterinarian has diagnosed your cat with ringworm, he or she will explain what you must do to prevent the fungus from spreading to your other pets—and to the human members of the household. But keep in mind that if you have other pets, it’s likely that most of them have been exposed as well. Your veterinarian may recommend that you do the following:%&07%•Bathe all pets in the household with a medicated rinse or shampoo.%&07%•Wash the infected animals’ bedding and toys with a disinfectant that kills ringworm spores.%&07%•Discard items that are impossible to thoroughly disinfect (carpeted cat trees, etc.)%&07%•Frequently vacuum to rid the house of infected hairs and skin cells. (Yes, the fungus can survive on hair and skin that your cat sheds!)%&07%•Thoroughly wash your hands after you bathe or touch your cat.%&07%If a cat with ringworm is not properly treated, the lesions can spread over large areas of the animal’s body, causing hair loss and skin infections.%&07%","cat, diseases",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-photos.appspot.com/o/cat%2F23.cat-ringworm.webp?alt=media&token=ddc2fb3f-4bf6-4364-8902-5e339fa3a5a8
Upper Respiratory Infections,ASPCA,"A cat’s upper respiratory tract—the nose, throat and sinus area—is susceptible to infections caused by a variety of viruses and bacteria.%&07%Causes of Upper Respiratory Infections%&07%•Viruses are the most common causes of upper respiratory infections (URIs) in cats.%&07%•Feline calicivirus and feline herpesvirus account for 80 to 90% of all contagious upper respiratory problems, and are prevalent in shelters, catteries and multi-cat households.%&07%•These viruses can be transmitted from cat to cat through sneezing, coughing, or while grooming or sharing food and water bowls.%&07%•Once infected, cats can become carriers for life, and though they may not show clinical signs, they can still transmit the viruses to others.%&07%•Cats often develop bacterial infections secondary to these common viral infections.%&07%•There are also upper respiratory infections in cats that are primarily caused by bacteria. Chlamydia and Bordetella—commonly found in shelters and areas with multiple cats—are two such bacterial infections.%&07%•Less common in cats than dogs, Bordetella is usually associated with stress and overcrowded living conditions.%&07%Preventing Upper Respiratory Infections%&07%•Keep your cat indoors to minimize the risk of exposure to infected animals.%&07%•Properly isolate infected cats to protect other pets living in the same environment.%&07%•Minimize stress.%&07%•Keep your cat up to date on vaccines as recommended by your vet. Vaccines for upper respiratory disease in cats may not actually prevent infection, but they help lessen the severity of the disease in some cases.%&07%•Regular veterinary exams and preventative care can help catch and treat problems early. A cat’s best defense against upper respiratory infection is a healthy immune system.%&07%•Practice good hygiene and wash your hands thoroughly when handling multiple cats.%&07%Symptoms of Upper Respiratory Infections%&07%Symptoms differ depending on the cause and location of the infection, but some common clinical signs of upper respiratory problems in cats include:%&07%•Sneezing%&07%•Congestion%&07%•Runny nose%&07%•Cough%&07%•Clear to colored nasal discharge%&07%•Gagging, drooling%&07%•Fever%&07%•Loss of or decreased appetite%&07%•Rapid breathing%&07%•Nasal and oral ulcers%&07%•Squinting or rubbing eyes%&07%•Open-mouth breathing%&07%•Depression%&07%Diagnosing Upper Respiratory Infections%&07%•Age, vaccination status and physical condition all play a role in a cat’s susceptibility to upper respiratory infections.%&07%•Cats who live in multi-cat households or shelters are most susceptible.%&07%•Veterinarians have found that stress plays a role in causing outbreaks of URI, and cats in any shelter, cattery or boarding facility are generally experiencing high levels of stress.%&07%•Cats who have recovered from URI can become carriers, and may experience recurrences when stressed.%&07%•Certain breeds like Persians and other flat-faced breeds have a predisposition to develop upper respiratory infections due to their facial structure.%&07%It’s important to bring your cat to a veterinarian if you think she may be suffering from an upper respiratory infection.

Worms in cat,ASPCA,"Cats can acquire a variety of intestinal parasites, including some that are commonly referred to as “worms.” Infestations of intestinal worms can cause a variety of symptoms. Sometimes cats demonstrate few to no outward signs of infection, and the infestation can go undetected despite being a potentially serious health problem. Some feline parasitic worms are hazards for human health as well.%&07%Common Types of Worms in Cats%&07%Outdoor cats and those who are routinely exposed to soil where other animals defecate are prone to worms. Kittens and cats who do not receive regular preventative health care are most at risk for developing complications associated with internal parasites.%&07%•Roundworms are the most common internal parasites in cats. Resembling spaghetti, adult worms are three to four inches long. There are several ways cats can become infected. Nursing kittens can get roundworms from an infected mother’s milk, while adult cats can acquire them by ingesting eggs from the feces of an infected cat.%&07%•Hookworms are much smaller than roundworms—less than an inch long—and reside primarily in the small intestine. Because they feed on an animal’s blood, hookworms can cause life-threatening anemia, especially in kittens. Hookworm eggs are passed in the stool and hatch into larvae, and a cat can become infected either through ingestion or skin contact.  %&07%•Tapeworms are long, flat, segmented parasites that range from 4 to 28 inches in length. An infestation can cause vomiting or weight loss. Cats acquire tapeworms by ingesting an intermediate host, like an infected flea or rodent. When cats are infected, tapeworm segments—actual pieces of the worm that resemble grains of rice—can often be seen on the fur around a cat’s hind end.%&07%•Lungworms reside in the lungs of a cat. Most cats will not show any signs of having lungworms, but some can develop a cough. Snails and slugs are popular intermediate hosts of this type of parasite, but cats are usually infected after eating a bird or rodent who has ingested an intermediate host.%&07%•Though means of transmission can vary, one of the main ways that cats get worms is through the ingestion of the feces of infected felines. Mother cats can also pass on worms to their kittens.%&07%Worm Prevention%&07%•Keep your cat indoors to avoid exposure to infected cats, rodents, fleas and feces.%&07%•Make sure your home, yard and pets are flea-free.%&07%•Practice good hygiene and wear gloves when changing cat litter or handling feces. It’s also important to frequently dispose of stool.%&07%•Ask your veterinarian to recommend an appropriate internal parasite treatment or prevention program for your cat.%&07%Symptoms of Worms in Cats%&07%Symptoms differ depending on the type of parasite and the location of infection, but some common clinical signs include:%&07%•Diarrhea%&07%•Worms visible in stool or segments of worm seen near anus%&07%•Bloody stool%&07%•Bloating or round, potbellied appearance to abdomen%&07%•Weight loss%&07%•Vomiting%&07%•Constipation%&07%•Anemia%&07%•Coughing%&07%•Trouble breathing%&07%If you think your cat may have worms, it’s important to bring her to a veterinarian, who can confirm the presence of worms. Avoid self-diagnosis, since worms are not always visible or identifiable.%&07%Treatment for Worms%&07%Please don’t attempt to treat your pet yourself—your cat should be treated for the specific type of worms he has.%&07%•Not all dewormers eradicate all types of worms.  Your veterinarian will determine the type of worm(s) infestation(s) your cat has, and prescribe the best course of treatment.  Your veterinarian will also be able to tell you if the dewormer should be repeated, and when.%&07%•Not all dog medications are safe for cats.%&07%•Some over-the-counter deworming medications can be harmful if used inappropriately.%&07%Transmission of Worms from Cats to Humans%&07%A large number of roundworm eggs can accumulate where cats defecate. People, especially children, who ingest such eggs can develop serious health problems, such as blindness, encephalitis and other organ damage. Treatment of blindness caused by roundworm may involve surgical removal.%&07%Hookworm larvae can penetrate human skin and cause lesions.

Bird's Nutrient,The Spruce Pets,"An imbalanced or incomplete diet is a common problem with pet birds and is a relatively common cause of illness. There is a lack of scientific study on avian nutrition, especially as it relates to the different species. While our avian nutrition is still in the early stages, most experts agree that a good diet for parrots begins with a formulated diet with a variety of other foods added as supplements.%&07%Seeds%&07%For most pet birds, especially parrots and parakeets, a diet based primarily on seeds is deficient in many nutrients, including vitamin A and calcium, and is too high in fat. This is not to say that seed does not have a place in avian diets, but many birds come to prefer them to the exclusion of other healthy choices and can be fussy when it comes to trying a varied diet. Some birds will even pick out a couple of favorites from a seed mix, which further reduces the nutritional balance in the diet. When it comes to parrot nutrition, consider seeds to be like junk food: birds love them, but they are not the healthiest choice. For most species of parrot, seeds should be strictly limited if not eliminated from your bird's diet. A diet high in seeds will increase the risk of high cholesterol, heart problems, obesity, and fatty liver disease. Some species, like budgies and cockatiels, are naturally seed eaters and can tolerate a higher percentage of seed in the diet, but even for these birds, seeds should only make up about 25 percent of the diet.%&07%Formulated Diets%&07%Several years ago, realizing that many parrots were suffering from nutritional deficiencies, companies began producing pelleted diets for pet birds. These are made from a variety of foods including grains, seeds, vegetables, fruits, fortified with vitamins and minerals, and are baked into pellets or variety of other extruded shapes. These provide a balanced nutritious diet and prevent birds from picking out their favorite food items and leaving the rest. However, many birds, especially those who have started on a seed-based diet, do not readily take to eating a formulated diet. Also, formulated diets, though well balanced, do not provide the variety and stimulation that many pet birds crave in their diets (after all, eating the same thing the day after would be boring for anyone). Therefore, a pelleted diet should comprise 50 to 75 percent of what the bird eats, and 25 to 50 percent should be fresh vegetables, while fruit can be 5%.3%&07%Some good brands of formulated diets include Harrison's, Zupreem, Kaytee, Pretty Bird, and Roudybush. As these diets grow in acceptance and popularity, manufacturers are producing lines formulated for particular species and also for health management (e.g. lower-calorie diets for weight management). As mentioned earlier, these diets come in a variety of shapes from larger chunks down to crumbles, and you may need to experiment to find the type your bird prefers. Some birds, especially those used to a seed-based diet, may be difficult to switch to a formulated diet. Zupreem has great resources on different ways to convert your parrots diet over to pellets!%&07%As we come to a better understanding of the nutritional needs of birds, the recommended diet for pet parrots includes a variety of nutritious freshly prepared foods in addition to a formulated diet (pellets) and a small percentage of seeds/nuts. Remember that most freshly prepared foods will spoil readily and should be removed from the cage after a couple of hours. If your bird is not readily accepting new foods, try offering them early in the morning or in the evening, times when birds naturally forage for food in the wild.%&07%Vegetables%&07%Fresh vegetables are a great addition to your bird's diet. Not all vegetables are equally nutritious though; vegetables like celery and lettuce are high in fiber and water but are otherwise not all that nutritious. Dark yellow and leafy green vegetables are usually excellent choices. You can offer vegetables in a variety of forms to entice the bird to try them—fresh whole or chopped, or cooked and fed slightly warm. Try hanging vegetables from the side of the cage in a clip or offering them in chunks that larger birds can pick up with their feet to gnaw on. You may need to be creative to get them to try things and the aim is to get your bird to eat as many kinds of vegetables as possible. Try a variety of vegetables such as:%&07%•Carrots (root and tops)%&07%•Sweet potatoes%&07%•Leafy greens such as collards, kale, turnip greens, mustard greens, Swiss chard, beet greens, and dandelion greens%&07%•Parsley%&07%•Coriander%&07%•Green beans%&07%•Peppers (bell, cayenne, jalapeno, banana, or cherry)%&07%•Cauliflower%&07%•Broccoli (head and leaves)%&07%•Zucchini%&07%•Sugar snap or snow peas%&07%•Squash%&07%•Corn (kernels, or on the cob for larger birds)%&07%Remember, no avocado!%&07%Fruits%&07%Again, you want to feed a wide variety, not just a favored few. Many birds love fruit and will overdo it so limit fruits to a small portion of the overall diet. As with vegetables, many of the more deeply colored fruits contain more nutrition, and it is good to try feeding a variety of more tropical types of fruits parrots might be exposed to in their native habitats. However, make sure they do not eat pits or apple seeds as these can be toxic.4 Try fruits such as:%&07%•Pineapple%&07%•Grapes%&07%•Papaya%&07%•Mango%&07%•Persimmons%&07%•Oranges%&07%•Grapefruit%&07%•Tangerines%&07%•Apples%&07%•Star fruit%&07%•Passion fruit%&07%•Plums%&07%•Strawberries%&07%•Raspberries%&07%Other Foods%&07%Birds can also be fed a variety of nutritious grains, such as cooked brown rice, quinoa, oats, wheat, barley, and pasta. Whole wheat bread and unsweetened whole wheat cereals can also be offered. Cooked legumes such as beans, lentils, and peas are an excellent addition to their diets. Birds can also be offered small amounts of cooked eggs.%&07%Sprouted Seeds%&07%Sprouted seeds are an excellent source of nutrition for pet birds and an excellent way to supplement them with greens. Freshly sprouted seeds are a nutritional gold mine, as the seed mobilizes its nutritional content into a highly digestible and bioavailable form as it starts to grow. Sprouted seeds are rich in vitamins and minerals as well as enzymes and antioxidants, and some consider them to be nature's most perfect food. In any case, they are an excellent way to provide a nutritional boost and most birds love them. Be sure to thoroughly wash them prior to feeding them to your parrot due to bacteria that can cling to the plant!%&07%Vitamin and Mineral Supplements%&07%It is usually a good idea to offer a cuttlebone (for extra calcium) but otherwise, extra vitamin and mineral supplements are not needed if you are feeding a well-balanced diet based on formulated foods supplemented with a variety of nutrition home-prepared foods. Additional supplements should only be given on the advice of your veterinarian.%&07%Foods to Avoid%&07%Stay away from junk foods and any foods high in fat, salt, or sugar. Birds are also lactose intolerant, so don't feed milk products.%&07%%&07%WARNING%&07%Chocolate, avocado, and rhubarb are toxic to birds. Of course, do not give any beverages containing caffeine or alcohol. Avoid processed meats or other foods high in nitrates, nitrites, sulfites, or monosodium glutamate (MSG). Onions, garlic, sprouted lima, fava and navy beans, fruit pits and apple seeds should also be avoided.%&07%%&07%Some experts and owners are concerned about feeding peanuts in the shell because they can be contaminated with Aspergillus fungus, which can cause respiratory illness as well as producing a toxin (aflatoxin, a potent carcinogen).%&07% If you feed raw peanuts, which should be in very small quantities in the birds diet, get good quality human grade peanuts and do not feed if there is any sign of mold. Shelled, blanched (unsalted, of course) peanut are fine. All food should be inspected and discarded if there are any signs of mold.%&07%","bird, nutrient, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20bird.png?alt=media&token=56f2b01f-2a09-4a6b-87de-bf55fdfb079a
How to Train Your Pet Bird,The Spruce Pets,"It's one of those necessary evils of bird ownership that you must learn to live with. The good news is that although many claim that there is no way to ""housebreak"" or ""potty train"" a bird, there are in fact ways to teach your pet the proper places to relieve itself—sun conures are a perfect example. While it won't happen overnight and can be a bit more complicated than teaching a cat or dog, many owners find that the benefits of such training are well worth the effort.%&07%Train Yourself%&07%The first step in potty training your bird is to train yourself. Each day when you interact with your pet, pay close attention to any ""signals"" the bird may give you before relieving himself. These can be as subtle as a change in posture, a certain ""look"" in the bird's eyes, or a ruffling of tailfeathers. Some birds become restless when sitting quietly in one spot for a long time and this can indicate they need to go to the bathroom. Every bird is different, and will thus use different body language, but if you know your bird and learn to ""read"" it, it won't take you long to catch on.%&07%Pay Attention%&07%Another thing to pay attention to is the frequency of your bird's droppings. Many birds will use the bathroom as often as every five or 10 minutes, but again, this is highly individual. If you watch your bird, you may begin to see a pattern in its restroom habits, and if you take note of the amount of time it takes between poops, you will be better at judging when your bird is ready for a potty break.%&07%Find Places to Go%&07%Once you've gotten a good idea of your bird's natural bathroom schedule, you can begin to work with your bird on learning the right places to go potty. The first thing to do is to decide where you want your bird to relieve itself. This can be any number of places, such as the bird's cage, a garbage can, or a piece of newspaper or cage liner. Whatever you decide on, it's important to stick with it as much as possible. Many bird owners train their pets to potty on a piece of wastepaper, as this is the most portable and easily disposed of.%&07%When you've chosen the proper place, the only thing you must do is take your bird to it (or if it's a piece of paper, hold it under the bird) when it's time to go potty— sounds simple, right? The trick is anticipating the bird's need to use the bathroom, which is where knowing your bird's potty habits comes into play. If, for example, you noticed that your bird relieves itself about every seven minutes, then you should place your bird over its designated poop space every seven minutes. There may be times when your bird does not need to poop as often as normal, and that's okay—if you notice that your bird hasn't pooped after being held over the potty space for a minute or two, let it resume playing, and just try again after one to three minutes have passed.%&07%Give Praise%&07%When your bird uses the bathroom in the correct area, be sure to praise it with kind words and tasty treats. As time passes, it will begin to understand that pooping in the right place yields great rewards. This can take many months of training, however, so don't be surprised if your bird has a few accidents, and don't be angry with your pet if it ""misses the spot"". Remember, it's your responsibility to pay attention to your bird's body language and schedule and get the bird to the proper place to go potty.%&07%With persistence and plenty of positive reinforcement, many birds take to potty training quite readily and quickly learn that pooping on humans (or furniture) is not encouraged. While it does require effort on the part of the owner to make sure that accidents don't occur, most claim that it's much easier than tending to the laundry and messes that un-trained birds create. Have fun with your bird and make potty training a learning experience for both of you—and never again worry about losing your favorite shirt to a ""bird bomb""! (And if your bird does have an accident on your favorite shirt, know how to clean bird poop out of clothing.)%&07%","bird, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20bird.png?alt=media&token=56f2b01f-2a09-4a6b-87de-bf55fdfb079a
How Long They Live,The Spruce Pets,"If you just adopted a baby bird, you can generally expect to spend many happy years with your new pet. Exactly how many depends on a variety of factors, though, some of which are out of a bird owner's control.%&07%Species%&07%The first factor in determining your bird's lifespan is its species. While it's true that birds can and do live for quite a long time, some live longer than others. Birds like budgies and cockatiels, for example, can live for up to 20 years in captivity provided that their needs are met and they are well cared for. This means that they will have a considerably shorter lifespan in general than other types of larger parrots, such as macaws, who can live for nearly 100 years in captivity under optimal conditions. This is based on the bird's biological makeup and nothing more; environmental factors are not considered when determining the possible lifespans of these species.%&07%Environmental Factors%&07%Of course, environmental factors always do come into play when considering the lifespan of individual birds. To make sure that your bird has the best possible chances of living a full and happy life, you must do what you can to control environmental risks to your pet's health. Using the following tips can help you make sure that your bird gets the most out of life, both in quality and quantity:%&07%•Practice good hygiene: Making sure to employ basic hygiene practices will greatly reduce your bird's risk of bacterial or viral infection and disease, resulting in a greater chance that your bird will be able to live its full lifespan in your care. This includes washing your hands before handling your pet, keeping his or her cage clean, and restricting contact with your bird when you are sick.%&07%•Healthy diet: Nutrition is just as important to the health of a pet bird as it is to a person. Providing your bird with a varied diet full of healthy, fresh foods will make sure that he or she is getting the proper vitamin intake to support the body and build a natural immunity to illness and disease.%&07%•""Bird-proof"" your home: Taking proper safety precautions can go a long way toward making sure that your bird is able to live his or her full lifespan in your care. This includes creating bird-safe spaces in your home so that your bird can play and exercise without the danger of getting into substances or situations that could harm your pet, as well as taking care of things like wing trimming to prevent fly-aways and other types of accidents that can result in tragedy. There are many household dangers to pet birds that may not seem obvious to a human, so do plenty of research to make sure that you are doing all you can do to protect your pet from accidents and injuries.%&07%•Regular vet checks: If your bird appears healthy it can be tempting to skip annual check-up with your avian vet, but it is very important that you take your bird to be evaluated on a regular basis even if he or she appears fine. Birds are very good at hiding illness and injuries—in the wild, they must. Any sign of weakness will make them the target of a predator, so nature has caused them to evolve to be very good at masking things when they aren't feeling well. A trained and qualified avian vet can pick up on subtle signals that your bird may be suffering from a health problem that you may miss, so keeping up with vet appointments is imperative to making sure that your bird lives a long and fulfilling life.%&07%Care Considerations%&07%There are things around the home that are considered hazardous to birds. Things you probably wouldn't think of like your cookware, scented candles, and deodorizers. The respiratory systems of birds are delicate. If you are a smoker, then a bird might not be the right fit for you. Some plants are perfectly safe, while others are potentially fatal to birds. It is important to know about all the household hazards that can harm a bird.%&07%Some birds require stimulation and need to keep their brains busy to curb less-than-appealing behaviors like excessive noise or destroying their cage. Much like children, if you give parrots toys to keep them entertained, these positive activities can go a long way. There are many kinds of toys you can provide for them. There are foot toys, hanging toys, and vertical toys that are hung on the inside wall of a cage that acts as a play board, and there are puzzles.%&07%You might want to invest some time in training your pet bird. Training helps strengthen the bond you have with your parrot. Most birds look forward to the one-on-one attention involved in training sessions. With successful training usually comes lots of praise and attention and their favorite treats. In addition, teaching some simple commands will make handling your parrot easier.%&07%Keep your bird healthy and wash your hands every time after you handle your bird. Birds can carry germs that make people sick. These bird-borne illnesses are rare in the United States, but you will still need to be vigilant about handwashing. Psittacosis, or ""parrot fever,"" is a potentially serious disease of pet birds, and it can be transmitted to humans. The risks are not great, but it is best to be aware of them.%&07%","bird, general, training",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20bird.png?alt=media&token=56f2b01f-2a09-4a6b-87de-bf55fdfb079a
Healthy Habits for bird,The Spruce Pets,"Birds are extremely smart and emotionally sensitive animals. Because of that, however, pet birds—especially the highly intelligent kinds, like parrots—can get bored if they're not engaged regularly.%&07%While keeping such intelligent creatures constantly occupied seems like an almost impossible task, particularly when you're out of the house, there are ways to ensure your pet bird doesn't suffer from boredom.%&07%Hold Your Bird Regularly%&07%Taking a few minutes out of each day to hold and handle your bird can provide immense positive mental stimulation to your feathered friend. Handling your bird often also helps develop and maintain the bond that you have with your pet. Ask any bird owner—the happiest parrots are those who get to spend the most time with their people.%&07%Not only do most tame pet birds enjoy physical contact from their owners, handling your bird every day will help you become more familiar with your bird's body and understand their body language. This gives you the upper hand in discovering any physical abnormalities and changes to personality that could signal illness or injury.%&07%Rotate the Bird's Toys%&07%Much like young children, birds get bored playing with the same old toys after a while. Bird toys can be pricy, though, so some owners opt to keep a stash of several different types of toys and rotate different ones in and out of their bird's cage every couple of weeks. This way, your bird will get to play with ""new"" toys every now and then, which will help keep him mentally occupied. Make a quick batch of homemade bird toys to offer even more variety to your feathered friend.%&07%Teach Tricks to Your Bird%&07% The time that you'll spend working with your bird when teaching the animal some tricks, plus the tasty treats that he or she will get as a reward for a job well done, provides plenty of stimulation for your pet. At the same time, it provides socialization time and strengthens the bird-owner bond.%&07%As your bird progresses, you can always add new tricks to help keep the process fresh. A bonus: You'll have a great time showing off how cute and smart your pet is!%&07%Play Music or Videos%&07%Birds are naturally interested in different sounds and noises, so leaving a radio or television on helps to keep them happy and comfortable while they are spending time in their cages. You can even log the types of music that your bird responds to the most or check out some popular songs about birds to make a custom playlist for your feathered friend.%&07%Provide Plenty of Food Options and Foraging Opportunities%&07%In the wild, parrots dine on an array of different fruits, vegetables, seeds, berries, and nuts. It's no wonder, then, that they tend to get bored in captivity eating the same old pellets and seed mix day after day. Additionally, they must find food in the wild and spend hours doing this- encourage this behavior at home with your parrot by introducing foraging!%&07%Along with keeping your bird happy and occupied, adding more variety to your bird's diet in the form of fresh fruits and vegetables can give your bird's body a healthy boost of vitamins and nutrients. For extra fun and expanded options, cook up some homemade bird treats in your own kitchen. Place these treats into paper that is easily shred-able or pick up a puzzle from the pet store to put it in and watch them work out how to get to it- it’s a big reward mentally for them!%&07%","bird, general, health, handling",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20bird.png?alt=media&token=56f2b01f-2a09-4a6b-87de-bf55fdfb079a
Choosing a Bird Cage,The Spruce Pets,"A bird's cage is a safe, spacious home, large enough so that it can move freely to stretch its wings and perform the acrobatics and strengthening to stay healthy both emotionally and physically. Placement of the cage in an active living area is better than in a back bedroom as frequent traffic promotes socialization.%&07%Birds need daylight for energy and mood elevation, but they also need quiet and dark at times of rest and sleep. Because they naturally roost in areas under tree canopy cover, all birds must always have the choice of getting out of the direct sun, heat, or dry air. Birds will seek out cooler, shady areas at will.  %&07%Before a bird can be let outside of its cage, the entire room area needs to be made bird-safe. Electric wires are chewing hazards so hide them well or cover them with insulation. Windows and doorways are exit hazards, so make sure there are secondary doors to be a final boundary. Glass doors are non-obvious impact hazards, so make sure to leave them open.%&07%Consider all potential high and low flight pathways and note that birds often like to follow their owners from room to room. Be careful not to shut inside doors behind you when a bird is in your living space, or you might hear a thud on the other side of the door. All house plants also need to be non-toxic to birds.%&07%One of the basics of bird ownership is providing your pet with adequate living space. With all the different sizes, colors, and models of bird cages today, it's easy to become overwhelmed when shopping for a home for your pet. Although it seems there are endless choices when it comes to the types of bird cages available, there are a few simple guidelines you can remember that will make the process of choosing one much easier.%&07%Location and Placement%&07%The first of these rules is to decide where your bird's cage will be located, and shop based on what will work with the area you have set aside. The area should be away from windows and drafts, yet in an active part of your home to encourage your pet's social development.%&07%Choosing the Right Size%&07%Next, of course, is to keep the size of your bird in mind. While it is perfectly fine to keep a Finch or Canary in a small space, larger birds need larger cages, and it is always better to buy the largest cage you possibly can for your bird. Keeping a bird in a cage that's too small can lead to undesirable behaviors such as screaming, biting, psychological disorders, and feather plucking, to name a few. A good cage should be large enough for your bird to walk around comfortably, and fully extend and flap her wings. Don't forget to take into account the space that will be lost when you add your bird's perches, food bowls, and toys! Consult your avian veterinarian for recommended cage sizes for your particular species.%&07%Bar Spacing%&07%Another thing to look at when selecting a cage is the bar spacing. Smaller birds, such as parakeets and lovebirds, require cages with bars no more than a half inch apart, to prevent them from squeezing through or becoming stuck between the bars. Many bird owners have been surprised to find that their pets are quite the little escape artists! Those who own larger birds should look for bars that are placed horizontally rather than vertically, to give your bird a means of climbing and exercise.%&07%Shape and Style%&07%The style of the cage is also an important factor. According to some veterinarians, round cages have been found to be detrimental to birds' psychological health, so angled cages are preferable. Many of these cages can either be hung or placed on a stand and come in a variety of sizes and shapes to accommodate any species of pet bird.%&07%Quality and Craftsmanship%&07%Assess the overall quality of a birdcage before you buy it. Does the cage appear sturdy and solid? Are there any loose parts or sharp edges? The best cages are made of stainless steel, which is non-toxic, easy to clean, and will not chip. The primary function of a bird's cage is to protect it - make sure that your bird's home does not pose any hazards to his health and well-being.%&07%A properly designed birdcage normally gives the bird and owner many years of use and enjoyment. You should remember that your bird will spend a great deal of time in his cage, and much like a person will appreciate some decorations to look at! Fill your bird's cage with colorful toys, perches, and accessories to ensure that he is well entertained. With some planning and careful decision making, you should be able to choose a cage that will meet all your expectations while providing your bird a safe, sturdy, and secure living space.%&07%","bird, general, shelter",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20bird.png?alt=media&token=56f2b01f-2a09-4a6b-87de-bf55fdfb079a
Bird Health Issues,The Spruce Pets,"Avian Flu%&07%Several years ago, cases of avian flu made the news around the world, and recently they have again been popping up in the headlines. While most of the cases focused on involve birds that are raised as food, pet bird owners should know that avian flu can affect birds of any species—meaning that parrots and other commonly kept pet birds are also at risk of contracting it if exposed. While the risk of exposure to captive pets is considered minimal, there are things that can be done to further protect your feathered friend from this deadly pathogen.%&07%Parasites %&07%Parasites can affect any animal, including birds and humans. It is important to monitor your pet bird for any signs of internal or external parasite infestations as children, other pets, and other family members can also contract them if exposed. Certain parasites can be deadly to pet birds if not treated quickly, so learning as much as you can about their signs, symptoms, and risks of exposure is imperative to protecting your pet and family.%&07%Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) %&07%One health problem that strikes fear into the hearts of bird owners is Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease, also known as ""PBFD."" It is a deadly virus that causes abnormal beak and feather growth, lesions, and various other problems. PBFD can affect any parrot species, and there is currently no known treatment or cure. To make matters worse, PBFD is highly contagious, and can quickly spread throughout an entire flock of birds who are kept in close quarters. It is important to learn about the signs of PBFD to prevent the spread of this devastating illness to other birds that may be owned by you or your friends and family.%&07%Egg Binding %&07%Those who own male birds can breathe easy here—egg binding is a condition that can only affect female birds of breeding age. Egg binding is a very serious problem and can cause death in affected birds if it is not promptly treated by an experienced avian vet, so it is important for those who own female birds to become familiar with the signs and symptoms of egg binding so that they can recognize any problems early enough to save their pets.%&07%Stress %&07%Pretty much every adult alive knows what stress is, but many don't realize that stress can also affect parrots and other pet birds, and just as it does in humans, it can cause a decline in immune response and make a bird more susceptible to other illnesses. While they are subtle, there are several different signs that bird owners can watch for so that they can identify stress in their birds and prevent the onset of more serious issues. It's important to learn about what can cause stress in your feathered friend and what you can do to reverse it if it has become a problem.%&07%","bird, health, diseases",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20bird.png?alt=media&token=56f2b01f-2a09-4a6b-87de-bf55fdfb079a
Pet Bird Behavior Problems,The Spruce Pets,"Just like children or cats and dogs, parrots and other pet birds sometimes exhibit behavior problems that their caretakers find difficult to manage. While there are several ways that birds can misbehave and irritate the people they live with, several behavior issues are more widely reported. Thankfully, most of these problems have rather simple solutions if owners are capable of putting forth a little time and effort. Read on to learn about the five most common behavior problems in pet birds, what your bird means by exhibiting these behaviors, and what you can do to fix them.%&07%Biting %&07%Biting is one of the most commonly reported behavior problems with pet birds,1 and it's no surprise―bites hurt! Thankfully, it can be easy to correct biting behavior in birds if you can identify the cause. If your bird has been chomping at you, ask yourself a few questions about your pet. Could your bird be frightened of something? Could the biting be hormonal in nature? Is the bird simply trying to play with you? Once you can figure out where the behavior stems from, you can take steps to discourage it from starting back up again in the future. For example, birds who bite out of fear can be gradually desensitized to people.%&07%Screaming%&07%Screaming is another undesirable behavior that many bird owners report as a nuisance. While all healthy birds scream and vocalize at some point throughout the day, problem screaming can result from boredom, depression, or some other type of stress that your bird is experiencing.2 If you've considered all factors and consulted with an avian veterinarian to rule out any medical problems, you may want to talk to a parrot behavior consultant for help with modifying your bird's behavior if the screaming doesn't begin to calm down on its own.%&07%Destructive Behavior%&07%Destructive behavior in parrots is often a sign that a bird either has a problem with his or her environment or isn't receiving enough mental stimulation to keep its mind occupied.3 Birds are highly intelligent and need lots of attention in order to keep from becoming bored. If your bird shows signs of blatantly destructive behavior, assess how you are spending your time with your pet and take steps to include your bird in your daily activities. Doing so can greatly reduce destructive tendencies in most pet parrots.%&07%Territoriality%&07%Often, birds who suddenly become territorial are simply experiencing hormonal problems due to the onset of breeding season.4 However, territoriality can have other triggers and can be a sign that your bird is not as happy and comfortable with you as you might like him to be. To help curb territoriality and related behaviors, try practicing some bonding techniques with your feathered friend. Improving your relationship on a fundamental level can go a long way in terms of resolving behavior problems with your pet. If you find your bonding practices aren't helping things improve after a reasonable amount of time, consider hiring a parrot behavior consultant for help.%&07%Feather Plucking%&07%Feather plucking can occur in cases where birds are severely depressed and unsettled in their environments. If you notice feather plucking in your pet bird, you should immediately consult with an avian vet to rule out the possibility of diseases such as psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD).5 If medical causes for your bird's plucking are ruled out, it's imperative to consider the way you are housing, feeding, and interacting with your bird. Keeping your pet in a cage that's too small or too dirty, feeding food lacking nutrients, and not paying enough attention to your bird can all cause your pet to start plucking his or her feathers. Keep your bird healthy and happy by doing all that you can to provide the best care possible.%&07%","bird, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20bird.png?alt=media&token=56f2b01f-2a09-4a6b-87de-bf55fdfb079a
Stress in bird,The Spruce Pets,"Why Do Birds Experience Stress? %&07%Like humans, birds can experience stress for several different reasons. Birds are creatures of habit. A change to their schedule or environment can be a stressor.%&07%Changes to the environment, from a move to a new home, new family members or pets, outside noises (construction, trucks, thunder), paint color, or change of location can cause stress. A new routine (the owner's or the bird's) can be stress inducing. Unfamiliar wild animals, even seen from the window, like hawks, raccoons, deer, or something else can upset a bird. A change in the light cycle, like a move to a darker room, daylight savings, or a cage covering, can all cause a bird to be rattled.%&07%Signs Of Stress in Birds %&07%Birds can exhibit stress in several different ways. They should all be taken seriously, and a vet should be consulted as soon as you notice these signs. Some can be more physically harmful than others, but all should be a matter of concern. Signs to look for include:%&07%oStress Bars%&07%oFeather Picking and/or Self-Mutilation%&07%oAggression%&07%oLoss of Appetite%&07%oChange in Vocalization%&07%oRepetitive Behavior%&07%oFear%&07%oBoredom%&07%Stress Bars%&07%One of the most common physical indications of stress in pet birds is the appearance of stress bars on a bird's feathers. Stress bars are small lines that run horizontally across the shafts of a bird's feathers. While it can be difficult to assess stress bars in feathers that are still on a bird, examining molted feathers can give a quick indication of whether a bird is having issues with a stressor in its environment. The presence of stress bars will not indicate exactly what is wrong with a bird. Rather, they're a red flag that bird owners can use to start looking for potential sources of stress that their pets may encounter.%&07%Feather Picking and Self-Mutilation %&07%Another common sign of stress (and boredom) in birds is feather picking. It can occur in both large and small birds. It may be initiated by a stimulus (loud construction noise) but continues once the stimulus stops. Some birds will continue beyond self-picking into self-mutilation. They can chew on their skin, and some will dig even deeper into the muscle or even bone. This can cause severe damage. Birds with these symptoms should be seen by a vet right away. They may be prescribed medication and fitted with an Elizabethan collar so they can't access their body.%&07%Aggression %&07%The sudden onset of aggression in a pet bird can also be an indicator that the bird is experiencing stress in its environment. Aggressive behaviors, such as biting, hissing, lunging, and excessive screaming, can manifest almost overnight.%&07%If you notice this sort of behavioral change in your pet, it may be a good idea to schedule an appointment with an avian vet to rule out any possible health problems. If your bird gets a clean bill of health, then you can begin to figure out exactly what triggers the behavior, and how you can adjust your bird's environment or routine to make it more comfortable.%&07%Loss of Appetite %&07%If a bird who normally has a healthy appetite suddenly begins to show less interest in eating, it can be an indicator of stress and/or health problems. A good rule to follow in this type of situation is to schedule an appointment with an avian vet to make sure that the bird is not sick or injured. If your feathered friend's health checks out, you can then begin to try and decipher possible stressors in your home that may trigger appetite loss in your bird.%&07%A Change in Vocalization %&07%Some stressed birds will begin screaming. While occasional loud noises can be typical, purposeful screaming can be loud and annoying and a sign of stress. Other stressed birds will go in the opposite direction and decrease their vocalizations. A significantly quieter bird can be a sign of stress, boredom, or sickness.%&07%Repetitive Behavior%&07%Some birds, and especially cockatoos, will exhibit stereotypical behaviors when they are stressed. These could include pacing, toe-tapping, and head swinging. They exhibit these behaviors to stimulate themselves when extremely bored.%&07%Fear%&07%If a bird that is normally happy to be handled suddenly begins to act fearful of you or other family members, the person may be causing stress to the bird without even realizing it. It may not even be something that the person is doing directly to the bird; something as simple as a brightly colored shirt, a hat, or a new beard or mustache can be a trigger for a bird's fearful behavior.%&07%Once you can identify a trigger, it is normally easy to remedy this sort of situation. If necessary, it is possible to condition a bird to eventually accept this sort of stressor through patience and practicing proper bonding techniques.%&07%Boredom%&07%Birds who begin to exhibit destructive behavior are quite possibly very stressed, and the most likely culprit in this scenario is boredom. Being the extremely intelligent creatures that they are, pet birds in captivity often do not receive a healthy amount of mental stimulation, which can lead to frustration, stress, undesirable behaviors, and even health issues.%&07%Treatment of Stress in Birds %&07%If there's a stressor in the bird's environment, removing it should cut down on its stress almost entirely. If the behavior is self-destructive and/or the stress cannot be determined, speak to a vet as soon as possible to come up with a treatment plan. A vet may prescribe a prescription treatment and/or recommend a behavioral specialist.%&07%If the bird has started acting out due to stress, and you need to try to curb its behavior, there are a few things you can try at home:%&07%oDon't yell at your bird. Whatever you do, don't yell at a stressed or frightened bird. Not only will it startle the animal at the moment, but it may also teach the bird that bad behavior gets attention.%&07%oMove slowly. If your bird attacks you because it's afraid or nervous, moving away quickly may agitate the animal further. Try to move slowly when approaching your bird, reaching into its cage, or attempting to pet it.%&07%oStick trains your bird. If you have a bird who doesn't like being handled but who you want to help become more social, offering it a stick or a perch to climb on may soothe it.%&07%oProvide Stimulation. Challenge your bird with stimulating puzzle toys, a TV to watch, a radio to listen to, or something exciting that will maintain interest.%&07%oOut of Cage Time. Some birds will benefit from extra attention from their owner and may appreciate more time out of their cage.%&07%Prevention %&07%While stress may not be entirely preventable, pay attention to your bird's cues and try to avoid sudden changes to its lifestyle. If a cage has been moved and the bird doesn't like it, move it back to slowly acclimate it to a new position. If new pets or family members are upsetting, again, try to acclimatize the bird to the new member and focus on positive reinforcement (and treats). Being aware of the bird's general sensitivities before any changes are made will help prevent stress.%&07%","bird, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20bird.png?alt=media&token=56f2b01f-2a09-4a6b-87de-bf55fdfb079a
Agression in bird,The Spruce Pets,"How to Stop Aggressive Behavior%&07%There's no such thing as a mean bird. There are, however, birds that are fearful and those with emotional problems that cause them to want to avoid being handled. When one of these birds finds itself in a situation as a pet, it can be problematic for both bird and owner, possibly leading to bird aggression. Fortunately, you can train your bird to enjoy the time it spends with you.%&07%Why Are Pet Birds Aggressive?%&07%The most common causes of aggression in birds are fear or previous traumatic experiences. These can lead to handling problems, bites, and attacks when birds are interacting with their owners and others.1 Yet, birds are complex, and any number of things can lead to aggressive behavior:%&07%•Fear often develops in pet birds that were not hand-fed when they were young.%&07%•A lack of proper socialization may lead a bird to be afraid of humans, other birds, or new experiences.%&07%•Some birds become jealous when their owner interacts with other people. This plays on the natural ""pair bonding"" instinct many bird species have, and, in captivity, you may be seen as your bird's partner.%&07%•If you adopted an older bird, it's possible that it was mistreated or neglected in some way by its previous owner.%&07%•Some birds become aggressive during their adolescence due to hormone changes. This will typically pass once the bird gets through this stage.%&07%•Protecting their claimed territory, such as the birdcage or feeder, can lead to aggression.%&07%•Birds that are stressed or lack mental stimulation may also act out.%&07%How to Stop Aggressive Behavior%&07%If your pet bird bites you when you try to handle it, you must set aside time each day to work on handling your feathered friend. This doesn't have to be anything specific; you can incorporate your attempts to reduce your bird's aggression into normal handling. For instance, you might need to work on bonding with your bird or train it to enjoy petting. You can even teach it how to do fun bird tricks. The point is that the more you work with your bird, the more it will enjoy your company, and the less aggressive it will act.%&07%When working with your pet, a few tips and techniques will help it to learn that handling is safe and fun.%&07%Move to a Neutral Location%&07%If possible, move your bird's cage to a neutral location during training sessions. Removing a bird from its ""territory"" can sometimes make it more willing to cooperate with its owner and prevent any territorial aggression.%&07%Don't Force Contact%&07%If your bird lunges at your fingers when you place your hand near it, try not to jerk away suddenly out of fear. Your swift movements will likely make your bird even more nervous and apprehensive.%&07%Taking it slow and easy is the better method; don't try to force contact. Try to leave it up to the bird to decide when it's comfortable enough to step up or accept a treat.%&07%Try Stick Training%&07%Training a bird to step up on a stick or a perch is referred to as ""stick training."" It's the recommended alternative to training a bird that's not able to be handled at first. It's a less invasive approach and easier for a bird that is fearful or was traumatized in the past to accept this way of moving without force.%&07%Avoid Yelling%&07%Raising your voice in anger (or pain) will not make your bird understand that it has done something wrong. In fact, it's more likely to reinforce your bird's bad behavior as it will love getting such a big reaction out of you. Whatever happens, avoid the temptation to yell at or punish your bird.%&07%Bear Gifts%&07%Offer your bird treats and speak in a soothing voice when you're trying to handle it. Using treats and praise will help your pet be more willing to interact with you and it's much more effective than discipline. If every interaction with your bird results in a positive experience, it will likely become more comfortable and open to a closer relationship with you.%&07%Many people try to force interaction in the hope that this will stop the bird from resisting, and it will simply give in to being handled. This is referred to as ""flooding"" and it's not recommended as a training technique.%&07%Build Trust Through Repetition%&07%With birds, repetition and consistency are keys to training. Make time to work with your bird at least once a day to ensure success. Keep in mind that it sometimes takes a while to build up trust with a bird, so don't give up!%&07%Don't Overwork Your Bird%&07%Initially, keep training sessions at a 15-minute maximum. Birds are intelligent and sensitive creatures, and they need to have some fun in order to maintain their mental health and keep from becoming stressed.%&07%Break the Pair Bond%&07%If your bird becomes jealous of your interactions with other people, you will need to enlist the help of family members and visitors. The goal is to better socialize your bird and show it that these people are not a threat to the relationship it has with you.%&07%Try various confidence-building exercises with other people and stay nearby to show your approval. You might, for instance, have visitors offer your bird a treat whenever they enter the house. To reinforce good behavior, they should also praise the bird in a happy, upbeat voice while making eye contact.%&07%Another exercise is to lay out your bird's food on a towel in front of the bird and have your family pick at it with their fingers, just like a bird does with its beak. If you do this regularly, your bird may want to join in the fun. They can also help you clean the cage or give your bird food or water so it is comfortable with your family's presence.%&07%Keep a Flexible Routine%&07%Birds need mental stimulation, and many enjoy a routine, so regular time for food, play, and other interactions each day is a good idea. However, some birds may react negatively if a routine is too rigid and gets disrupted.%&07%For example, if you get home from work at a certain time each day and immediately let your bird out for playtime, being late one day could lead the bird to act out. Try to employ some flexibility in your daily routines that involve your bird. It will help the bird better tolerate change and understand that things won't always happen in a particular order or at a certain time, but it will happen.%&07%Get Professional Help%&07%If you put in the necessary effort, chances are you will be able to train your pet in a reasonable amount of time. If your bird is so aggressive that you cannot attempt training exercises, the first thing you should do is visit your avian veterinarian to rule out any health concerns. When no physical reasons can explain your pet's undesirable behavior, contact a certified parrot behavior consultant for an expert opinion on your situation.%&07%","bird, aggression, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20bird.png?alt=media&token=56f2b01f-2a09-4a6b-87de-bf55fdfb079a
Common Diseases in Pet Birds,The Spruce Pets,"As a bird owner, it is important to be aware of the common bird diseases and disorders that can affect your precious pet. Early detection of illness is key to successful treatment in pet birds, so it is crucial to learn about some of the most common illnesses that affect birds in captivity.%&07%If you notice your bird exhibit any of these signs of illness or other uncharacteristic behavior, seek the attention of a qualified avian vet as soon as possible.%&07%Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD)%&07%Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD) is one of the most confounding avian disorders. The disease affects the nerves that supply the bird's gastrointestinal tract, though it can also affect nerves that supply other organs, too.%&07%PDD is also known as Macaw Wasting Syndrome and Parrot Wasting Syndrome because it's most commonly diagnosed in Macaws, African grey parrots, Amazon parrots, cockatoos, and conures.%&07%Symptoms of PDD include weight loss, vomiting, changes in the bird's droppings, and a swollen crop, which is the muscular pouch near the throat. However, no one sign or symptom can distinguish PPD. Some birds may not show any signs of illness until they are very sick with the disease.%&07%Treatment will often be nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the bird may have to be put on a special diet.1 However, there's no cure for the disease, so these treatments are just to reduce pain for the rest of the birds' lives.%&07%Psittacosis (Parrot Fever)%&07%Psittacosis, or ""Parrot Fever,"" is a form of the Chlamydia bacterium that can affect all hookbills. The disease is highly contagious and can be passed from birds to other animals, as well as humans.%&07%Symptoms of Psittacosis aren't specific, but they include difficulty in breathing, nasal and eye discharge, inappetence, and loose, watery droppings with general lethargy. Treatment is most often an antibiotic, tetracycline, which can be given orally or through injections. However, birds taking tetracycline cannot have calcium because of its effect on the medication.%&07%Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)%&07%PBFD is a serious illness that can affect all members of the parrot family and has been referred to as ""bird AIDS,"" given the similarity between the diseases. Although most affected birds are under the age of two years, PBFD can affect birds of any age.%&07%Symptoms of PBFD include feather loss, abnormal feather development, the absence of powder down (dander), and growths, lesions, and abnormalities of the beak. If a bird is showing symptoms, the veterinarian may do a skin and/or feather biopsy.%&07%Currently, there is no treatment for PBFD, so a vet will recommend supportive care that includes pain management.1%&07%Polyomavirus%&07%Polyomavirus is a disorder that affects caged birds, particularly parrots. Birds that are newborn or juveniles are most at risk, and the disease is usually fatal.1%&07%Symptoms of polyomavirus include appetite loss, an enlarged abdomen, paralysis, and diarrhea. Some birds may not show outward symptoms at all but are carriers of the virus and may shed it in times of stress, posing a risk of infection to other birds in the home.%&07%There is no known treatment for polyomavirus. This disease can progress quickly and has a high mortality rate. If your bird is at high risk of exposure, aka they are exposed to many other birds, vaccination is available to help reduce the risk of illness.%&07%Candida%&07%Candida, or Candidiasis, is a fungal infection that can affect the digestive tract of all species of birds. The disease involves an overgrowth of yeasts that are normally found in a bird's digestive system.2%&07%Common symptoms of Candida infections include white lesions in and around the mouth and throat, vomiting, appetite loss, and a crop that is slow to empty. The bird might appear to be lethargic.%&07%Most Candida infections are successfully treated using antifungal medications. Candida often develops secondary to another disease, so the bird should be examined and treated for all potential problems by a vet.%&07%Avian Flu%&07%The risk of contracting avian flu is not particularly high for housebound pet birds. However, there are two factors that can cause the risk of infection to increase.%&07%The first risk factor is if a pet bird spends any time outdoors, where it might come in contact with wild birds. To minimize the risk, do not allow your pet outside without supervision. Even if your bird is securely in its cage outdoors, watch it closely to keep wild birds and other animals away.%&07%The second risk factor is the sale of wild-caught birds in the pet trade. On top of causing the wild birds severe trauma by ripping them away from their natural environment, this practice can play a role in introducing many diseases, including the avian flu, to people's homes and aviaries.7%&07%So if you are looking for a new bird, seek a reputable breeder or rescue group to ensure that your new pet is healthy. If you have recently purchased a bird that you suspect was captured from the wild, schedule an appointment with an avian veterinarian as soon as possible. Avian vets are capable of testing for diseases specific to birds, such as the avian flu, and they can offer your bird treatment if necessary.%&07%Keeping Your Pet Bird Healthy%&07%One risk to a pet bird's health is improper care from its owner. Always wash your hands before and after handling your pet bird to mitigate the spread of any diseases. And make sure you’re thoroughly cleaning its environment on a regular basis to remove feces, old food, and other waste that can potentially spread disease.%&07%A quality diet is one of the primary ways to maximize a pet bird’s healthy lifespan.8 In addition to nutritious seeds and pellets, make sure you’re feeding your bird a mix of leafy greens and other vegetables, some fruits, grains, and nuts. Consult your veterinarian for the optimal diet for your specific bird. %&07%Furthermore, provide your bird with plenty of space and toys to promote exercise. An overweight bird is at risk of many diseases.9 Plus, make sure your bird has ample social time, either with you or other pet birds (or both), to maintain its mental and physical health. And finally, schedule regular wellness checks with your avian vet. Birds can succumb to diseases very quickly, so it’s important to closely monitor their health throughout their lives.%&07%","bird, health, diseases",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20bird.png?alt=media&token=56f2b01f-2a09-4a6b-87de-bf55fdfb079a
Sickness in Pet Birds,The Spruce Pets,"Many new bird owners may not know the symptoms of bird sickness, and birds are often good at hiding them. There are a few tell-tale signs you should watch for to have the best chance of saving your pet from a life-threatening ailment. If your bird exhibits any of these symptoms, contact your veterinarian as soon as possible.%&07%Signs of Sickness%&07%Birds are sensitive and intelligent creatures. They are also usually creatures of habit. While they may try to hide their symptoms, paying close attention to their daily activities, behavior, and general attitude.1 Trust your gut. If you suspect something is off with your bird, it's better to speak to your vet before things get worse. As a bird owner, there are some common symptoms should all be on your radar.%&07% Mynah Bird: Bird Species Profile%&07%Bird Droppings%&07%It's not the most pleasant task to monitor your bird's droppings, but they can clearly show that something may be wrong.1 While the color of your bird's droppings may vary slightly depending on what you feed it, you should watch for droppings that are yellow, rusty brown, or tarry black.%&07%These can be indicators of internal bleeding or other serious problems. Pay attention to any major changes in the consistency of your bird's droppings. Whether they're too runny or too firm, they can cause complications for your pet.%&07%Ruffled Feathers and Weight Loss%&07%Birds that sit with their feathers fluffed out for prolonged periods of time are often affected by respiratory problems or other disorders.1 Ruffled feathers may also conceal weight loss, which can be life-threatening for a bird. If you observe this behavior in your pet for more than a day or so, you should contact your vet as soon as possible.%&07%Weight loss can be devastating to a bird's health, not only in terms of reduced strength but inhibition of organ functions as well. Weigh your bird regularly so you'll know if your pet is having trouble maintaining its weight.%&07%Red, Inflamed, or Runny Cere or Eyes%&07%Your bird's cere is what you might perceive as its nose; it's the little patch above the beak that holds the nostrils. Pay close attention to your bird's cere. If you observe any redness, inflammation, or discharge, there's a good chance that your pet could be seriously ill.2 Make sure to keep your bird wrapped up and warm on the way to the vet. Likewise, If your bird's eyes look cloudy or there's a discharge coming from them, the bird could be affected by a respiratory, nervous, or muscular disorder. %&07%Reduced Appetite %&07%Birds have an extremely high metabolism, so it's vital that they receive adequate nutrition every day. If your bird stops eating and begins to lose weight, it may be a sign of an intestinal blockage or impaction, in which case it could die very quickly without medical attention.3 Make sure to clean out the bottom of your bird's cage every day before you feed it. This provides an easy way to monitor food consumption, as well as changes in droppings.%&07%Open-Mouthed Breathing%&07%Respiratory problems are among the most common bird sicknesses and, unfortunately, the most serious. If you see your bird breathing with its mouth open while it's at rest, there's a good chance that it's not only sick but has been for quite a while.4 This requires immediate veterinary attention and may lead to hospitalization.%&07%Dirty Feathers%&07%Birds are, by nature, hygienic animals that bathe frequently and preen their feathers daily to keep them clean. If you notice feathers around your bird's face or rump that appear messy or stuck together, it's an indication that your pet could be sick.4 Monitor the bird's food consumption and droppings closely for a day or so, note any changes, and relay this information to your vet.%&07%Tail Bobbing%&07%As with many common signs of illness in birds, prolonged, repetitive bobbing of the tail can indicate a respiratory infection.2 Unlike people, birds lack a diaphragm that separates the chest cavity from the stomach. The muscles located at the base of the tail help birds breathe by playing a part in expanding their lungs for air intake.%&07%If a bird is having trouble breathing, the tail muscles work harder, causing the tail to bob up and down. Tail bobbing is often not noticeable until later, more serious stages of illness, so if you see your bird behaving in this manner, call the vet immediately.%&07%Changes in Vocalization%&07%Much like humans, birds that don't feel well often become less talkative than usual. Pay close attention to your bird so that you can learn its normal vocalization patterns. Stay in tune with the way your bird behaves, so you can pick up clues as to the way it feels. If you notice any changes in the frequency or general tone of your bird's vocalizations, monitor it for additional symptoms over the next few days.5%&07%Treatment and Prevention%&07%When it comes to your pet bird's health, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Birds have very delicate systems, and even a minor illness can turn into a serious threat in the blink of an eye. Early diagnosis can be vital to saving a sick bird's life.%&07%•Examine your bird daily for any signs of infection, and make sure to maintain a close relationship with your vet.%&07%•Provide your bird with toys and a regular exercise routine, which will positively affect its mental health, and talk to your bird (even if it doesn't talk back) so it gets the social interaction it needs.%&07%•It's also important to feed your bird a varied diet to make sure it's getting enough vitamins and minerals. Consult your vet if you're not sure of what foods are appropriate for your particular breed.%&07%•Keep your bird's enclosure clean. While most birds take care of their own personal grooming, it's up to the owner to make sure that any waste is cleaned up promptly and that the bird's food and water are fresh and readily available.%&07%Your bird depends on you to maintain its good health. Make sure to keep tabs on its behavior so that you can keep your little friend around for a long time.%&07%If you suspect your pet is sick, call your vet immediately. For health-related questions, always consult your veterinarian, as they have examined your pet, know the pet's health history, and can make the best recommendations for your pet.%&07%","bird, health, diseases",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20bird.png?alt=media&token=56f2b01f-2a09-4a6b-87de-bf55fdfb079a

Caring for Pet Chameleons,The Spruce Pets,"Chameleons are a unique and bright species that have the ability to change in color to camouflage with their environment, regulate temperatures, and communicate with other chameleons. They can also change color when they're stressed or happy. Caring for a chameleon requires proper natural habitats meaning big cages to accommodate their need to climb, privacy, and various temperatures throughout its home. Additionally, they need a gut-loaded and calcium supplemented diet. This beautiful creature may be the pet for you if you're willing to make the commitment to properly care for it.%&07%WARNING%&07%Being territorial and solitary animals, chameleons should be kept by themselves; males are especially aggressive toward one another.%&07%Behavior and Temperament%&07%Young chameleons are usually a dull gray/brown color and can change shades a bit. At around five months of age, the adult color and the ability to change colors develop, and a range of colors—including green, blue-green, turquoise, and black—can be seen.%&07%Changing colors provide camouflage, temperature regulation, and a means of communicating with other chameleons. Similar to anoles, chameleons change colors in response to excitement, stress, temperature, lighting conditions, the presence of another chameleon, and other influences.%&07%Generally, a dark brown to black chameleon is stressed, with the brighter colors reflecting a happier mood.%&07%Chameleons use their tongues to catch prey. A chameleon's tongue can be up to 1.5 times the length of its body, allowing chameleons to catch insects from a distance. They primarily eat insects, but some will eat vegetation and small invertebrates.%&07%Chameleon feet have three toes pointing in one direction and two that point the opposite way, which gives them a good grip on the tree branches they spend most of their time on. Many species also have prehensile tails. They have globular eyes that rotate like turrets and move independently, allowing them to scan a wide radius to hunt for food and look out for predators.%&07%","reptile, chameleon, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20lizard.png?alt=media&token=01994fb9-de55-43b4-94dc-42833689630e
Housing a Pet Chameleon,The Spruce Pets,"The natural habits of chameleons make them tricky to care for. Chameleons are arboreal, meaning they live exclusively in trees. They need cages with ample foliage for climbing and privacy, and the enclosure must be quite large.%&07%For the larger chameleons a cage measuring 3 feet by 3 feet by 4 feet tall should be provided, but the more space the better. Ample ventilation is required, and a cage screened on three sides is best with poly mesh or vinyl coated wire preferred to prevent toe injuries.%&07%Branches of various diameters need to be provided for climbing and the bulk of the cage space should be filled with these branches or live foliage. Ensure that the plants are not toxic, as the chameleon may eat the foliage. Substrate made up of small particles (such as gravel, sand, bark, or moss) should be avoided to prevent the chameleon from accidentally eating it while catching prey.%&07%Several basking areas of various temperatures must also be provided in a chameleon's enclosure. Some chameleons are happier at higher temperatures, others at lower temperatures. Be sure to research the specifics for your breed.%&07%Chameleons get their water from droplets on leaves so as a rule, they will not take water from a dish. Adequate water intake must be provided either through a drip system or by misting the enclosure at least twice daily.%&07%Drip systems can be purchased or fashioned from a water container with a pinhole placed on top of the cage, or even by placing ice cubes on top of the cage to melt slowly and drip into the cage. If a drip system is used, keep the watering location consistent so the chameleon knows where to find water. Misting will also help keep the humidity levels up.%&07%With a drip system, excess water should be collected and removed to prevent the humidity from getting too high.%&07%Light%&07%Chameleons need exposure to UVA and UVB rays. In addition, allowing some exposure to natural sunlight through an open window (glass filters out nearly all of the necessary UV radiation) will help keep chameleons happy and healthy. The UVB lights should be on for 10 hours a day.1%&07%WARNING%&07%Follow manufacturer directions to make sure you do not cause thermal burns on your chameleon.%&07%","reptile, chameleon, shelter, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20lizard.png?alt=media&token=01994fb9-de55-43b4-94dc-42833689630e
Food and Water for chameleon,The Spruce Pets,"Chameleons seem to do best on a variety of insects so you should try to feed as many types of insects as possible to your pet. Crickets, mealworms, super worms, wax worms, wax moths, and roaches are all good items to feed.%&07%Prey food should be gut loaded with calcium prior to feeding and should be dusted with a calcium supplement.2 Some nutritious leafy greens (avoid spinach, lettuce, and cabbage) and other vegetables and fruits can be offered in small amounts as chameleons will occasionally eat these.%&07%","reptile, chameleon, nutrient, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20lizard.png?alt=media&token=01994fb9-de55-43b4-94dc-42833689630e
Common Health Problems in Chameleon,The Spruce Pets,"Many chameleons suffer from calcium and Vitamin A deficiencies, usually the results of a poor diet. They're also prone to mouth rot, or stomatitis,3 an infection around the mouth that shows redness and excess saliva or drooling.%&07%Another common ailment among chameleons is metabolic bone disease.1 This condition, which can be fatal if not treated appropriately, causes a chameleon's bones to become spongy.

Choosing Your Chameleon,The Spruce Pets,"When selecting a pet chameleon, it is best to find a captive-bred one. Wild-caught specimens are usually extremely stressed, carry a heavy parasite load, and have difficulty acclimating to captive conditions.%&07%Chameleons are not the hardiest nor easiest reptiles to keep, and starting with a stressed pet will only make matters worse. In addition, the capture and shipping of chameleons (which fortunately is being more tightly regulated) results in the deaths of many animals. Many more die in transit than make it to the pet store.%&07%Once you've found a captive bred chameleon, observe them. They should be bright and active, able to change colors, and have a well-fleshed body.%&07% The Different Types of Chameleons%&07%Different Species of Chameleon%&07%There are several species of chameleons that are popular as pets.

Dehydration in Chameleon,Chameleon Owner,"Description%&07%Although dehydration is not a disease in itself, it can lead to very serious diseases such as gout, kidney failure, and ultimately, death. Dehydration is the most common condition that plague chameleons and is in fact, the most common cause of death in pet chameleons.  %&07%Causes%&07%Dehydration is caused by inadequate water supply. It occurs when there is insufficient drinking water, or when the enclosure is not humid enough. However, if your water supply, misting system, and humidity level are just perfect, you may need to contact a certified vet as there may be some underlying disease condition. %&07%Signs%&07%Common signs to look out for are sunken eyes, folding skin, dry feces, yellow/orange urate, loss of appetite, and lethargy. These signs suggest the immediate need for a better misting system or water supply.%&07%Prevention%&07%Prevention is by the use of good misting systems and adequate supply of water to the chameleon. Also, the level of humidity must be adequate and well maintained.%&07% Treatment%&07%If you notice the signs of dehydration early enough, you can solve the problem by prolonging the misting periods. It is also beneficial if you allow the leaves in its enclosure collect water. Another alternative is to provide your chameleon its drinking water via a dropper. This way, you can be sure your chameleon drinks adequate water. The more intense the dehydration, the more water is needed for rehydration.%&07%","reptile, chameleon, diseases",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20lizard.png?alt=media&token=01994fb9-de55-43b4-94dc-42833689630e
Metabolic Bone Disease in Chameleon,Chameleon Owner,"Description%&07%Metabolic Bone Disease or MBD for short is the second most common chameleon disease. MBD is more accurately a general term which describes a collection of medical disorders that affect the bones. For example, they could stem from Nutritional Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (NSHP, which is the most common), Renal Secondary Hyperparathyroidism (RSHP), Hypertrophic Osteopathy (HO) and Osteoporosis.%&07%Causes%&07%This disease usually occurs when a chameleon is not adequately exposed to sufficient UVB. It can also be caused by a lack of dietary calcium and an imbalanced nutrition in general.%&07%Signs%&07%This condition is usually a slow process and as such, constant examination is important. Common signs of this disease are bowed legs, rubbery jaws, and clumsiness.%&07%With time, your chameleon may have some trouble with climbing, a loss of appetite, and difficulty in projecting the tongue to feed. If your chameleon fails to use its tongue at all, it is very important to quickly see a vet. Tongue problems not caused by physical damage are usually a sign of nutritional deficiency. %&07%Prevention and Treatment%&07%To avoid having to deal with MBD, make sure you gut load your insects with adequate vitamins and calcium.

Thermal burns in Chameleon,Chameleon Owner,"Description%&07%Domesticated chameleons are usually at a risk of getting thermal burns from the source of heat provided for them. This condition could be very serious and life threatening.%&07%Causes%&07%This condition occurs when the heat lamp is kept inside the enclosure or too close to the top of the cage. These locations give a chameleon direct access to the heat source and they tend to get real close. However, unlike humans, chameleons don’t have suitable skin sensation to enable them to get away quickly from extreme heat. Because of this insensitivity, chameleons are susceptible to thermal burns.%&07%Signs%&07%Common signs to look out for are gray/black blisters and/or necrotic tissue on the skin, infection, lethargy, closing one or both eyes.%&07%Prevention%&07%Minimize the chance of your chameleon getting too close to the heat source by not keeping it too close to the enclosure. Also, do not allow the heat bulb to touch the mesh on the topside. You should also avoid the use of high wattage bulbs when not necessary. Maintain a correct ambient and basking temperature.%&07%Treatment%&07%If burns have already occurred, it is best to consult the vet on what treatment options are available or on what care you have to give. It may take a long period of time before the burn scars finally erase, so you need to be patient with the healing process.%&07%Topical ointments such as Silvadene cream and sterile dressing can be applied.

Respiratory infections in Chameleon,Chameleon Owner,"Description%&07%A respiratory infection is a common health problem associated with chameleons. It characterizes an infection to the respiratory tract of a chameleon. It could be an upper or lower respiratory infection depending on the area the infection occurs. If it affects the lungs and causes pneumonia, it is called a lower respiratory tract infection. On the flip side, if it affects the nasal sinuses and mouth, it is an upper respiratory tract infection.%&07%Causes%&07%This condition is caused by a temperature that is too low in the environment or enclosure of the chameleon. It can also ensue when the cage is too wet or dry. It could also be caused by some other underlying problem. Upper respiratory infections are the most common among pet chameleons and are usually caused by environmental factors. The type of cage used can determine how humid or dry the air will be.%&07%Signs%&07%Signs of this disease include gaping, loss of appetite, labored breathing and lethargy. Other signs include popping or wheezing sounds, inflammation, bubbling around the nose and mouth, and excessive mucus. If your chameleon snores while sleeping, it may be a sign of this disease.%&07%Prevention%&07%Prevention of this disease is by ensuring the quality of the air in the enclosure remains uncompromised. This can be achieved by making sure to remove dirt and litter regularly from the enclosure, or other materials such as left over food which can breed infectious agents.%&07%Of greater importance is the temperature of the enclosure. Ensure that the temperature does not fall below 77 degrees at daytime, and 65 degrees at night time.%&07%Treatment%&07%Respiratory infections (whether upper or lower) could be fatal. This is why it should be detected very early and treated aggressively. Antibiotic agents used for treatment include Baytril or Fortaz. As soon as you suspect that your chameleon may have contacted this disease, take it to a vet. The more you delay, the greater the probability that your chameleon will die.%&07%Attempting to treat this condition at home, and all by yourself is highly discouraged. After the etiology of the disease is established, treatment may take up to one month and a month of special care too. During this period, your chameleon should be placed in an enclosure with an optimum temperature in order to help it fight the infection more effectively.%&07%","reptile, chameleon, diseases",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20lizard.png?alt=media&token=01994fb9-de55-43b4-94dc-42833689630e

Parasitic Infections in Chameleon,Chameleon Owner,"Description%&07%Parasitic infections are not uncommon in chameleons. These infectious agents could be bacteria, worms, flagellates, mites. Specific examples of the most commonly occurring parasites include cryptosporidium, nematodes, trematodes, and protozoa.%&07%Causes%&07%There are two major causes of parasitic infections in chameleons. One is when they are constantly fed wild insects and the other is a general lack of hygienic conditions. Wild insects are prone to various infections and these could be transferred to your chameleon when they eat them.%&07%Signs%&07%The signs of intestinal worm infections include a swollen belly, general weakness, and emaciation. Signs of infection with bacteria or protozoans include diarrhea, slimy feces, loss of weight, dehydration, loss of appetite, and feces with bad smell.%&07%Prevention%&07%Since the eradication of some protozoans could prove to be very difficult, it is best to prevent parasitic infections. This can be done by giving them insects which are healthy and not caught from the wild.%&07%In addition, there should be adherence to strict enclosure hygiene. Extra preventive measures that can be put in place include checking the fresh feces of your chameleon periodically. This will be done by a vet who will help you prepare a sample and view it under the microscope. This can help you detect parasites or infections very early.

Gout in Chameleon,Chameleon Owner,"Description%&07%Gout is a very serious medical condition and there are two types of gout: primary, and secondary.%&07%Primary gout occurs when a chameleon is fed with too much protein, while a secondary gout is caused by another medical condition. Kidney failure is a major cause of gout in chameleon (secondary gout).%&07%Kidney failure is a common cause of death in pet chameleons and in the long run, can lead to other debilitating conditions such as gout which is usually characterized by a painful swelling of the leg joints. Gout is a very complicated condition with a variety of signs and needs to be handled by a vet.%&07%Causes%&07%Kidney failure usually occurs when a chameleon is subjected to long-term dehydration or long-term use of certain veterinarian-prescribed antibiotics. Gout ensues when excess amounts of uric acid are produced in the blood. These uric acids usually flow in the bloodstream and get stuck at some capillaries and thereby cause swelling and pain.%&07%Signs%&07%Common signs include reduced mobility, swellings at joints, excessive drinking, loss of appetite, and extreme aggression especially when the joints are touched. Your chameleon may also show signs of pain when walking, climbing, and may be seen stand on three legs instead of four (will usually not stand on one of its hind legs).%&07%Prevention%&07%Kidney stones and gout are usually caused by low-level dehydration which may not be easily detected. To prevent this, maintain appropriate humidity in the enclosure (between 50-70%) and make sure the drip system is functioning well so as to ensure adequate humidity levels.%&07%Also, since the chameleon is a low protein animal, avoid feeding it with lots of protein. Feed it instead with lots of fruits and vegetables and ensure it drinks sufficient water always.%&07%Treatment%&07%The vet should be in charge of treating this condition. Treatment options include the prescription of medicines which will dissolve the uric acid crystals or an actual operation on the chameleon to remove the uric acid crystals.

How to Take Care for Your Pet Snake,The Spruce Pets,"Snakes are long, slender, and solitary animals. They are neither cuddly nor very friendly, but they can be excellent pets for the right people. And while their popularity as pets is on the rise, only a fraction of owners know the correct way to feed and care for them; the majority of pet snakes die in captivity, while the rest tend to escape or live unhealthy lives. Based on these observations, I have listed a set of instructions for the breeders and owners to keep their pets healthy and happy.%&07%Choose and Prepare a Quality Enclosure%&07%Peace at home is essential for all humans. Like humans, all animals share the same philosophy. Keeping a snake is different from other pets. They have specific requirements, and most of all, their homes (known as enclosures or vivarium) must imitate their natural habitats to prevent any discomfort. The following things must be kept in mind before designing an enclosure for a snake.%&07%","reptile, snake, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20snake.jpg?alt=media&token=304304f3-5e9e-49a2-93d1-214b9d379264
Housing for Snake,The Spruce Pets,"The size of the enclosure depends upon the length and weight of the pet snake. The favorable size for a pet snake is no more than 8-10 feet. Longer snakes require a much larger enclosure. For a medium-sized snake, an enclosure of about 20 gallons is adequate. While bulkier pet snakes such as boas and pythons can't live in smaller aquariums and need larger homes ranging up to 100 gallons or more in volume.%&07%Substrate%&07%As snakes in the wild adore their underground lifestyle, it is no brainer that they tend to burrow themselves while they live in captivity. Since most of the pet snakes have wild predecessors, their burrowing hunger can be only quenched by putting adequate substrate inside their enclosures. The substrate can be a newspaper/ soil or sand.%&07%The bottom of their enclosure can be lined with dry leaves, the bark of trees, and brown grass to give a natural touch. The quantity or thickness of substrate depends upon the snake. Some snakes require a substrate that is only an inch thick, while others like it more than several inches to give them a calm and secure feel.%&07%Mini Pool%&07%Being excellent swimmers in the wild, the majority of snakes are water-loving. As established, an ideal enclosure must emulate the exact natural habitats. Unfortunately, a swimming pool of some sort is nearly impossible inside an enclosure. But to prevent any malaise to the pet, it is advised to place a small water bowl or a mini pool inside the enclosure.%&07%The water must be drained, and the pool must be cleaned regularly. The temperature of the water must also be monitored and should be kept between 70–90 degrees Fahrenheit. The water natatorium not only refreshes the mood of the snake but also helps in thermoregulation.%&07%Monitor Temperature and Humidity%&07%Thermoregulation is vital to the survival of the snakes. They are cold-blooded reptiles that mainly get and dissipate heat into and from the environment. The optimum temperature for the majority of pet snakes is 75–85 degrees Fahrenheit.%&07%The substrate of the enclosure is essential in regulating the temperature of these reptiles' bodies. But one of the most important things in temperature maintenance is the water inside the enclosure. Thermoregulation for snakes is a complex phenomenon and requires a correct balance between the atmospheric, soil, and water temperatures to keep the metabolism of the snake on track.%&07%Humidity is another aspect that must be kept in mind. Although the ideal value is different for every species, a value of around 60% is suitable for most snakes. A water bowl inside the enclosure is vital in maintaining the mugginess. For ventilation, fans are installed to keep the air in circulation.%&07%","reptile, snake, general, shelter",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20snake.jpg?alt=media&token=304304f3-5e9e-49a2-93d1-214b9d379264
Feeding Snakes,The Spruce Pets,"Feeding a snake is different than the other pets. While our regular pets make certain noises and gestures when hungry, snakes exhibit no such phenomenon, mostly remaining quiet and solitary.%&07%As a result, snakes are often not fed often enough, and they try to escape the enclosure. This is a common reason that owners rehome or sell their pets—and it reinforces the stigma that ""snakes can't become pets.""%&07%The point I am making is simple: Like other pets, snakes require regular feeding. I have simplified the feeding chart below for your ease.%&07%When to Feed and How Much%&07%While snakes do exhibit signs of hunger, they're often very mild and are easily skipped by beginners, giving a false sense that their pet is not hungry. Hunger signs generally observed by experienced keepers include hyperactivity and escape attempts, and a hungry snake may even be driven to latch onto anything that comes within its radius.%&07%Feeding times vary by the kind of snake you have, their size and age, and many other variables such as shedding and breeding. Consult a vet and do your research to know what your particular pet's needs are. As a general rule of thumb, you must feed your snake once or twice a week. For some species, once a month is okay.%&07%By keeping a close eye on the quantity of the feed and the time taken by the pet to digest, you can crack the exact feeding pattern that suits your pet. It's a time-consuming process and requires detailed observation of signs and activities shown by the snake.%&07%What to Feed%&07%Anything that is fed to the snake must not be larger than the mouth of the snake to avoid any problem in swallowing. In contrast to natural conditions, pet snakes in captivity are not fed live animals/rodents; live rodents can seriously harm your pet, which may result in life-threatening infections. To avoid any serious complications, pet owners are advised to give their pets thawed mice/chicken.%&07%But freezing and thawing of already dead rodents will result in the growth of pathogenic bacteria. These pathogenic bacteria cause food poisoning in digestive issues. So, the owners are strongly cautioned in the case of spoiled or contaminated food.%&07%Cost of the Feed%&07%At present, the market is really small, and no company specializes in making snake food. But you can buy frozen rodents and amphibians from certain vendors and pet shops. Although the feed is cheap, the quality is something to keep in mind. A frozen medium-sized mouse can cost $5-20. Considering the rule of feeding once a week, a months’ worth of food will cost roughly $20-80. That is a broad range, but you should have a budget of around $60 to keep your pet satisfied.%&07%","reptile, snake, general, nutrient",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20snake.jpg?alt=media&token=304304f3-5e9e-49a2-93d1-214b9d379264

Most often this is due to poor husbandry for the specific species. Having temperatures and humidity levels outside of the snake’s natural range can easily cause issues with shedding. Inadequate nutrition, handling the snake during a shed, parasites, bacterial infections, and a lack of furnishings in the terrarium to assist in the shedding process can also contribute to dysecdysis.%&07%Diagnosis%&07%It’s easy to identify an incomplete shed by observing the snake. When a snake sheds healthily, there will be no leftover skin anywhere on the body and you will notice an entire piece of skin in the shape of your snake within the enclosure. An incomplete may slough off in pieces and some old skin may be left behind anywhere on the body, especially around the eyes and at the tip of the tail.%&07%Treatment%&07%An incomplete shed can typically be handled at home by soaking the snake in warm water or by wrapping them in a damp towel. You should never try to peel the skin off, as it can damage the new skin and cause the snake significant injury. Any time you are concerned about the leftover shed, reach out to your veterinarian for further guidance and assistance.%&07%","reptile, snake, diseases",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20snake.jpg?alt=media&token=304304f3-5e9e-49a2-93d1-214b9d379264
Infectious Stomatitis in Snake,PetKeen,"Infectious stomatitis is most often referred to as mouth rot, mouth canker, or ulcerative stomatitis. This is a painful condition that comes about due to a bacterial infection within the soft tissue in the mouth. If left untreated it may even spread into the bone. The most common bacteria associated with infectious stomatitis include but are not limited to pseudomonas, aeromonas, klebsiella, and salmonella.%&07%Signs of Stomatitis%&07%•Lack of appetite%&07%•Excessive salivation%&07%•Discharge or bleeding of the mouth%&07%•Mucous or pus in or around the mouth%&07%•Red, inflamed tissue%&07%•Lesions in the oral cavity%&07%•Open mouth breathing%&07%Causes%&07%Snakes can develop mouth rot for several reasons. Most often, it is due to a suppressed immune system being unable to properly fight off the isolated bacteria in question. Suppressed immunity can be the result of stress due to improper temperature and/or humidity, an unsanitary environment, inadequate nutrition, or even underlying disease. This can also happen as a result of trauma to the mouth.%&07%Diagnosis%&07%Diagnosis of infectious stomatitis is done through a physical examination by a licensed veterinarian. They may even collect a sample of affected tissue to obtain a bacterial culture and find the specific culprit.%&07%Treatment%&07%Prompt treatment is very important considering this is a painful condition that can become more severe and lead to further problems. Treatment typically involves either oral or injectable antibiotics and proper cleaning of the affected area with antiseptics. The underlying cause of the condition will also need to be addressed to prevent reoccurrence. Occasionally, infectious stomatitis may be so severe that surgical removal of dead tissue may be necessary.%&07%","reptile, snake, diseases",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20snake.jpg?alt=media&token=304304f3-5e9e-49a2-93d1-214b9d379264
Scale Rot in Snake,PetKeen,"Scale rot is a blanket term used to describe various types of dermatitis or skin infection seen in snakes. Scale rot may also be used to describe burns, abscesses, and any secondary bacterial infections associated with the skin.

While skin conditions appear to be surface level, it is important to figure out what the root cause of the problem is so that it can be solved and prevented from happening again.%&07%Diagnosis%&07%If scale rot is suspected, the snake should be evaluated by a veterinarian. They will go over the snake’s medical history and clinical signs and will likely ask you about your care practices. It is important to have the condition diagnosed as quickly as possible to prevent the condition from becoming worse and leading to a more severe infection.%&07%Treatment%&07%Treatment often includes the use of either oral or injectable antibiotics.

Parasites in Snake,PetKeen,"Snakes can be affected by both internal and external parasites, and both are quite common in captive reptiles. Internal parasites include roundworms, tapeworms, or even cryptosporidium, which affects the lining of the stomach and intestines. More often than not, internal parasites go unnoticed until a routine exam where a fecal test is performed.%&07%Mites are external parasites that reproduce quickly and will cause symptoms once the infestation becomes more severe.

Mites are fairly common at reptile expos and pet stores because of how many reptiles are present at these locations.%&07%Diagnosis%&07%Diagnosing internal parasites is done via a fecal exam completed by a veterinarian. Mites are typically easy to identify since they are visible to the naked eye. But they are incredibly small, and owners may not even notice until they observe their snake soaking in the water dish excessively. Mites can be seen in the enclosure, hidden within the scales, and around the eyes and mouth.%&07%Treatment%&07%Treatment for parasites will be dependent on the type of parasite affecting the snake. Antiparasitic medications will be administered by the veterinarian if internal parasites are the issue.%&07%Mites can be difficult to treat, and it can take several weeks to rid an infestation. Soaking the snake in gentle dish soap or even olive oil can help treat the mites on the skin. The enclosure will need to be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected frequently as you work to treat the mites.%&07%Certain sprays are made specifically for snake mites but always use caution with these insecticide sprays around your sensitive snake.

Housing A Tortoise,Pet Advocacy,"ABOUT TORTOISES%&07%While there are over 50 species of tortoises, relatively few are available as pets. Most pet tortoises are captive bred and include tropical species with different habitat and care requirements. %&07%There are several things to consider before acquiring a tortoise, such as: %&07%•size and weight of the adult tortoise %&07%•longevity – most tortoises will live 50 years or longer. %&07%•climate zone %&07%•habitat requirements %&07%•amount of and types of food consumed. %&07%•compatibility – small groups with different species can be kept together (best with only one male)%&07%ENVIRONMENT %&07%Tortoises come from different climate zones throughout the world. It is imperative that you replicate your tortoise’s specific natural environment as closely as possible. Temperature, humidity, sunlight intensity, terrain, diet, water, and seasonal changes (including microclimates) vary, although some species inhabit a wide range of environments within a region. Since you may not know which area your tortoise is from, you may have to test a variety of options.%&07%TEMPERATURE CLIMATES %&07%Greek, Russian (Horsfield’s), Hermann’s and Marginated Tortoises from southern Europe and the Middle East are popular temperate species. They inhabit different environs, from grasslands and forests to rocky hillsides and scrubland, and go through a moderate hibernation period. Their diet is heavy in grasses, leafy vegetables and fruit. These species prefer moderate humidity, generally 40-60%, with a less humid environment for the Russian tortoise (30-50%).%&07%ARID CLIMATES %&07%Tropical species include Red-footed and Yellow-footed Tortoises from South America; Elongated Tortoises from southeast Asia; and some Hinge back species from Africa. These tortoises do not hibernate. Tropical tortoises need a humid environment (up to 80% but with a humidity gradient in the enclosure). Unlike some arid species, tropical tortoises should be fed occasional animal protein in the form of frozen pinkie mice, earthworms, slugs, canned cat or dog food, or commercial tortoise pellets.%&07%INSIDE ENCLOSURES%&07%Habitat for tortoises varies by species and adults (see the table), but the minimum aquarium size is a 20-inch long (30-gallon) aquarium or reptile terrarium. Alternatives to aquariums include a large plastic tub with high sides, a child’s wading pool, or a large custom-made polyurethane-sealed, plywood enclosure. The sides of the enclosure should be at least twice the length of your tortoise. As your tortoises grows, increase the size of its habitat. If possible, set up an outdoor enclosure so that your tortoise can spend the appropriate time (weather permitting) in fresh air and direct sunlight.%&07%Your tortoise must have at least 12 hours of natural or artificial sunlight daily for vitamin synthesis to remain in good health. For indoor pets, an alternative to natural sunlight is a UV-B light (ultraviolet B) placed within four feet of the carapace (top shell) of the tortoise. This light must be direct, not filtered through glass or plastic.%&07%Tortoises require a higher temperature than humans. Just as important, tortoise habitats should have a temperature gradient across the enclosure for both day and night so the animal can seek a comfortable area; see the table below for species recommendations. An under-floor heat mat designed for reptile tanks placed in a corner of the habitat and a 75-watt incandescent bulb over the habitat will provide the necessary heat range. Use a thermometer to verify the temperature: if it’s too cool, your tortoise can develop respiratory problems; high temperatures can cause dehydration and death.%&07%The floor of the enclosure should be covered with a substrate material such as reptile bark chips and cypress mulch; for some species, rabbit pellets work well. These will allow for easy maintenance, waste removal, burrowing and proper maneuverability (walking and climbing). The substrate should be spot cleaned and turned daily, removing droppings and uneaten food.%&07%By including assorted pieces of flat rocks and wood, your tortoise will be able to keep its nails trimmed. Do not build places for your tortoise to climb, however. If a tortoise rolls over onto its back, it will not be able to right itself. Exposed to direct or artificial sunlight, it may succumb to the heat.%&07%Tortoises need shelter for sleeping and security. A large domed piece of cork bark, half of a ceramic drain tile or a commercial hide box are suitable. Make certain the shelter is large enough to accommodate the entire length and width of your pet.%&07%OUTDOOR HABITAT%&07%If your tortoise will be kept outdoors, the enclosure needs to provide protection from climate extremes, keep predators out, and be escape-proof. Tortoises are adept at digging, and enclosures should extend 12-24 inches below the surface. In addition, the area should be large enough to provide room for exercise, a basking site, a shelter for sleeping, and relief from hot, sunny days.%&07%Use a thermometer at the tortoise level to ensure the proper temperatures are being met. Heat can be provided by an incandescent bulb (75-100 watt) or a heat lamp mounted on the interior roof of the enclosure, out of the way of the tortoise. Heated and insulated doghouses can be ideal shelters. If the daytime temperature in your geographic area continually is below 80-85oF, your tortoise should be brought indoors.%&07%Add a removable basin for water large enough for the tortoise to soak once a week. A smaller container of water should always be available.%&07%Herbicides and pesticides can be fatal to tortoises. If the outdoor unit is on grass, make certain no herbicides or pesticides are used. Be aware that ants, especially fire ants, can kill tortoises.%&07%","reptile, tortoise, general, shelter",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20tortoise.jpg?alt=media&token=adcd3c5a-e00a-44f9-a126-ece01b9a6deb
Tortoise's Nutrient,Pet Advocacy,"Tortoises need a diet that is low in protein but high in fiber and calcium, primarily consisting of daily plant matter (spring mix, dark, leafy greens, and grasses/hay) and pellets. Fruits (berries, melon, kiwi, etc.) can be a smaller part of the diet.%&07%Calcium and vitamin D3 supplements should be sprinkled on the food a few times each week. Tropical species benefit from a small amount of animal protein, such as a frozen pinkie mouse once a month for Red-Footed tortoises or earthworms for Yellow-Footed and Elongated tortoises.

Stomatitis in Tortoise(Mouth Rot),The Turtle Hub,"Stomatitis, a.k.a mouth rot, is a common infectious disease of the tortoises. The initiation of this condition starts with a simple cut or minor wound inside the mouth of the tortoises. However, a bacterial attack can occur if the injury goes unprotected, leading to an infection or rot.%&07%But yes, this problem is not always associated with a cavity injury. Sometimes, tortoises suffer from stomatitis if they have a weak immune system. When the immunity of the tortoise is compromised, the harmful bacteria in the mouth dominate and cause inflammation. Thus, the creature experiences mouth rot.%&07%Causes%&07%Basically, the bacterial attack in the oral cavity or the overpopulation of bad bacteria is responsible for stomatitis in tortoises. Sometimes, these creatures suffer from mouth rot after coming out of hibernation.%&07%Hibernation or brumation is a natural part of the tortoises’ life. During the severe cold, these reptiles slow down their metabolism and go for months-long-sleeps. In those months, they do not eat or participate in regular activities.%&07%The immunity of the tortoises takes a low blow because of staying away from food and a normal lifestyle. Thus these creatures become more prone to infectious diseases like stomatitis.%&07%Symptoms%&07%Recognizing the mouth rot in tortoises is impossible at the initial stages.

Constipation in Tortoise,The Turtle Hub,"I am not sure if you are aware, but tortoises also become constipated. But of course, it is hard to recognize the condition as we do not keep any fecal journals for pets. However, the tortoises will drop signs if they are not pooping regularly.%&07%See, though a tortoise eats regularly, it does not release waste as frequently as other animals. Instead, the pet will take a dump when you soak it in warm water.%&07%Generally, a healthy tortoise poops every 2 – 3 days.

For example,%&07%Soaking In Warm Water:%&07%As I have mentioned, tortoises only take a dump when soaked. So, make regular arrangements for bathing the tortoises. Again, tortoises tend to drink water when bathing, which also solves the dehydration issue.%&07%One more thing.%&07%You need lukewarm water to soak your tortoise. This creature is not a big fan of cold water and may walk out of the pool if the temperature is not right. Moreover, a warm temperature is also necessary to encourage the tortoise to urinate or release feces.%&07%Work On The Diet:%&07%A poor diet is another reason for constipation in tortoises. Hence, the owners have to research first before making the meal plan for the pets. Adding fiber-rich content to the diet is mandatory.%&07%Laxatives:%&07%In severe conditions, the vets suggest laxatives that soften the stool and encourage the tortoise to poop. Though there are synthetic laxatives available, natural alternatives are always recommended. Bananas and pumpkins are two popular laxatives for tortoises.%&07%Maintain A Suitable Temperature:%&07%Tortoises are cold-blooded animals and require external heat to function correctly.

Shell Rot in Tortoise,The Turtle Hub,"Shell rot is one of the most common health issues of tortoises. A single cut or scratch on the shell can let in bacteria or fungus, which leads to severe rotting.%&07%Shell rot can cause immense pain in the tortoises if not treated fast. Even in some cases, the whole shell plate falls off from the structure exposing the cavities of the tortoise.%&07%Causes%&07%Apparently, the main reason for shell rot is the attack of bacteria or fungi. Tortoises can get damaged shells for many reasons. First, if the bacteria enter the shell by any chance, they quickly grow their population. Soon, they outgrow and start rotting the scute cells.%&07%In many cases, the bacterial attack spreads in the blood cells and bones. As a result, the disease gets more complex.%&07%A tortoise can get a scratch or crack on the shell in many ways. For example,%&07%•	In a fight%&07%•	Falling from a height%&07%•	Accident%&07%•	From a sharp-edged item in the enclosure%&07%Besides, low humidity and improper temperature inside the habitat can also lead to flaky shell skins.

But first, you have to identify the problem.%&07%Next, isolate the tortoise from the healthy ones as shell rot is highly contagious and infectious. Now, use a soft bristle brush to scrub the dirt from the wound. You can do the scrubbing when bathing the tortoise.%&07%After that, use a chlorohexidine or similar solution to kill the existing bacteria in the pit. Later, you can apply healing cream like silver sulfadiazine cream, Neosporin, or tribble antibiotic cream for a rapid recovery.%&07%Continuing this routine for a few weeks will heal the tortoise.%&07%However, you must take the tortoise to the vet if the shell rot takes a severe turn. For example, if foul discharge comes from the pits, the plates fall off, or the pet stops eating completely.%&07%The specialist will suggest medications and injections for healing. Besides, he will arrange a feeding tube to bring the tortoise back to a healthy state.%&07%As you can see, the tortoises suffer a lot because of shell rotting. Hence, you should really focus on the prevention of this disease. Some preventive measures are,%&07%•	Remove anything with sharp edges from the habitat.%&07%•	Do not place your tortoise on a height.%&07%•	Hold the tortoise with a solid grip while handling or transferring it.%&07%•	Feed the tortoise right to boost its immunity.%&07%•	Maintain a clean habitat.%&07%•	The humidity inside the enclosure should not be too low, and the temperature should be in a suitable range.%&07%•	If the tortoise gets a damaged shell, do a proper bandage so that the bacteria can not enter the system.%&07%","reptile, tortoise, diseases",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20tortoise.jpg?alt=media&token=adcd3c5a-e00a-44f9-a126-ece01b9a6deb
Vitamin A Deficiency in Tortoise,The Turtle Hub,"Hypovitaminosis A occurs in tortoises due to the lack of vitamin A.

Danio Fish General Care,The Spruce Pets,"Origin & Distribution%&07%The name “danio” was coined by Francis Hamilton in the early 19th century. This name comes from the Bangla name dhani, which means “of the rice field.” In 1916, the danio genus was split into two, but the two genera were re-combined in 1991.%&07%Male vs Female Danios%&07%Female danios are larger and rounder than males, especially during breeding season, when the female’s belly balloons with eggs. Male danios are more active than females and are more likely to show dominance in the tank. Males are also more streamlined than females.%&07%Because male danios are more dominant than females, males are more likely to show aggressive behavior in the aquarium. To avoid issues with aggression, don’t include more males than females in your tank. One male for every four females is the best ratio.%&07%The differences in pattern and color between male and female danios depend on the species of danio. Typically, males and females have identical patterning, but males are darker in color than females.%&07%Danio Tank Setup%&07%Replicating a danio’s natural environment in an aquarium is easy. Although danios have their preferred water parameters, most danios can withstand a variety of water conditions and temperatures.%&07%Tank Size%&07%A shoal of six to twelve danios requires a tank size of at least 10 gallons. If you plan to add other community fish to your aquarium, a 15-gallon tank is best.%&07%Danios become aggressive if housed in an overcrowded or undercrowded tank, so the tank should be the right size for the number of fish you have. Giant danios need more space to swim and require a tank size of at least 55 gallons.%&07%Water Temperature, Hardness, & pH%&07%The ideal water temperature for danios is 64–79°F, depending on the danio species in the tank. Danios prefers a neutral pH of 6.0–8.0. Maintaining water hardness at a soft to medium level is necessary. Keeping water conditions stable will prevent disease and stress.%&07%Advertisements%&07%You should buy a good filtration system for the tank to remove chemicals and retain optimal condition. The type of filter you need depends on the size of the tank and the number of fish in the aquarium.%&07%Substrate & Decoration%&07%Danios aren’t bottom-dwelling fish, so you don’t need to find a substrate that these fish can burrow in. However, using fine, soft sediment as a substrate will closely replicate the danio’s natural habitat. Make sure to thoroughly wash any substrate before you add it to the aquarium, to prevent water cloudiness.%&07%Smooth stones and gravel can be used to create a hillstream environment for your danios. Add pieces of bogwood to represent underwater tree roots.%&07%Freshwater plants like Amazon sword and Java fern give danios a hiding place and provide high concentrations of dissolved oxygen. Adding plants to the aquarium also increases habitat complexity, which reduces aggressive behavior in the tank.%&07%Danio Care%&07%Danios are easy to care for, but you should closely watch the behavior of these fish from the moment you introduce the species to your tank. Male danios spend a lot of time courting females, which can lead to fights amongst males. Adding females and males to the tank to a 4:1 ratio will reduce fights.%&07%Although danios are hardy fish, there are certain aquarium diseases that these fish are prone to.%&07%Diet & Feeding%&07%Danios eat plants, algae, zooplankton, worms, and small invertebrates in the wild. As opportunistic features, danios eat whatever they can find. This means that the diet of danios in captivity needs to be varied.%&07%Feed your danios dry food like pellets and flakes that are small enough to fit in the fish’s mouth. Use sinking pellets for danios that stray toward the bottom of the tank, like celestial pearl danios.%&07%Brine shrimp, white worms, and krill are good, nutritious live or frozen foods to feed your danios. Fresh vegetables like cucumber, zucchini, and spinach provide healthy vitamins and minerals for your fish. Cycle your danios’ diets to keep the fish healthy and reduce the risk of disease.%&07%Breeding Danios%&07%Breeding danios is straightforward. Some danios, like zebra danios, are especially good breeding fish for beginners.%&07%To breed danios, follow the steps below:%&07%Advertisements%&07%1.	Separate your chosen healthy males and females for a few weeks and set up a 10-gallon breeding tank, with a water temperature of 71–80°F.%&07%2.	Feed the separated males and females high-quality live foods, such as bloodworms and daphnia. The female should become rounder, which indicates the development of eggs.%&07%3.	After two weeks of feeding, place the males and females together in the breeding tank. There should be two males for every female.%&07%4.	Within 24 hours, the fish should spawn. Look for eggs at the bottom of the breeding tank. White eggs are infertile, while translucent eggs are fertile.%&07%5.	Remove the males and females after spawning and place the fish back into the home aquarium. This will prevent the fish from eating the eggs.%&07%6.	Wait up to three days for the fry to hatch. Add a sponge filter to the breeding tank as soon as the fry start eating.%&07%Should You Get a Danio for Your Aquarium?%&07%You should get a shoal of danios to occupy the middle to upper layers of a home aquarium if you can provide a varied diet, peaceful tank mates, and a complex habitat. Danios are also easy to care for, which makes them perfect for beginner aquarists.%&07%With that said, there are a couple of reasons that you shouldn’t get danios for your aquarium. If you keep long-finned fish, or if your community tank is already crowded, a shoal of danios won’t be a good addition to the aquarium.%&07%Danios are popular amongst aquarists because the fish have low care needs and come in a variety of striking colors.%&07%","fish, danio, general, shelter, nutrient",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20fish.png?alt=media&token=3e7020a9-4066-47b6-9be3-66d171b840be
Dwarf Spotted Danio Fish Species,The Spruce Pets,"The dwarf spotted danio that has had a long history in the aquarium industry is a hearty little fish from Myanmar. The earliest written descriptions of the spotted danio are from the early 1900s. Since the 1960s, the export of this fish was affected dramatically by the political instability in what was then called Burma. Along with the stabilization of the country since the 2000s, this beautiful fish has started to make a comeback in the aquarium trade.%&07%Species Overview%&07%COMMON NAMES: Dwarf danio, dwarf spotted danio, spotted brown, spotted danio%&07%SCIENTIFIC NAME: Danio nigrofasciatus%&07%ADULT SIZE: 2 inches, usually smaller%&07%LIFE EXPECTANCY: 3 years%&07%Characteristics%&07%Family-Cyprinidae%&07%Origin-Myanmar%&07%Social-Peaceful schooling fish%&07%Tank Level-All levels%&07%Minimum Tank Size-10 gallon%&07%Diet-Omnivore%&07%Breeding-Egg scatterer%&07%Care-Easy%&07%pH-6.5 to 7.0%&07%Hardness-5 to 12 dGH%&07%Temperature-74 to 82 F (24 to 28 C)%&07%Origin and Distribution%&07%This species originates in the lakes, streams, rivers, rice paddies, and various still bodies of water in Myanmar. The range of this species is relatively limited, having been found only in the central regions of the country, where it is primarily a seasonal fish. During dry periods of the year, water sources dry up, and this fish diminishes in number. When the monsoons come, bringing copious amounts of water with them, fish populations rebound.%&07%Colors and Markings%&07%The body is silvery in color and iridescent under good lighting. The most defining feature of this species is a single bold dark stripe that runs from gill to tail, turning bluer in color as it nears the tail. This stripe narrows when it reaches the tail, but continues through the tail fin. Above this stripe is a white stripe, which in turn is bordered by a much thinner dark stripe of the same color as the primary dark stripe. The small stripe often breaks up into a series of small spots as it reaches the area of the tail.%&07%Below the primary dark stripe is a series of small spots that cover the lower part of the body. The fins are relatively colorless for the most part, except for the strip on the tail fin, as well as spots on the anal fin. These spots on the anal fin are a means to identify this particular species. In addition to spots, the anal fin also is edged in pale brown. The brown anal fin edging is more predominant in males than females.%&07%Tankmates%&07%Spotted danios are a peaceful fish that get along with other species. However, they are rather timid. This, combined with their diminutive size, limits their suitability for community aquariums. They will do well when kept with other small species, particularly those from the same part of the world. This includes the glowlight danio and panther danio, among other species originating from Myanmar.%&07%Small tetras and rasboras are also suitable tankmates, as well as cory catfish. Spotted danios should always be kept in schools of at least a half dozen, preferably more. The larger the school, the less timid the individuals will be.%&07%Dwarf Spotted Danio Habitat and Care%&07%Spotted danios are most comfortable in a habitat that is similar to their native conditions. They do best in a well-planted aquarium of live plants, but artificial plants will do. A dark substrate is ideal for showing off the lighter colors of this species. Overhead lighting will also bring out their delicate coloration. Provide some bogwood and rocks to complete the river habitat. The aquarium should have a well-fitted cover as this species is inclined to jump.%&07%Water conditions are not extremely critical, but these danios are sensitive to build up of toxins, so regular water changes are recommended. Soft to moderately hard water is suitable, with an acidic to neutral pH. Like many other types of danios, this species can tolerate colder water temperatures, but when breeding, elevating the temperature is recommended.%&07%Dwarf Spotted Danio Diet and Feeding%&07%This species is omnivorous and will accept almost any food, including flakes, small pellets, freeze-dried foods, and frozen foods. They particularly relish small live foods, which should be provided as supplemental food when possible. In place of live food, use frozen bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia or mosquito larvae.%&07%Spotted danios will feed in the upper portion of the tank, but they are still rather timid and may not compete well for food with boisterous fish. If they are in a tank with more active species, take care to ensure the spotted danio is receiving its fair share of food. Use multiple feeding rings to help distribute food more evenly among tankmates.%&07% Feeding Rings for Your Fish%&07%Gender Differences%&07%Females are larger overall than males and have a rounder body. The slimmer male is more brightly colored, while females have more subdued coloration. In males, the anal fin has a golden tint with a light brown edging. When well-conditioned for spawning, the male becomes even more vibrantly colored, while the female will become rounder in the belly as she fills with eggs.%&07%Breeding the Dwarf Spotted Danio%&07%Spotted danios are relatively easy to breed. In some cases, they may spawn without any special accommodations. You may not even be aware that spawning has taken place. However, they are voracious egg and fry eaters; if the owner wishes to raise most or all of the spawn to adulthood, a separate tank is needed to ensure survival.%&07%A separate breeding tank can also serve as a grow-out tank. This tank should be set up with a matured sponge filter and filled only half to two-thirds full with water in the range of 77 to 79 degrees Fahrenheit (25 to 26 Celsius). Lighting should be dim, and the tank should be equipped with either a spawning mat or plenty of fine-leafed plants, such as Java moss. Alternatively, mesh can be used on the bottom to allow the eggs to fall out of reach of the adult fish.%&07%Condition the breeders with live foods before spawning. When the breeders are ready, place two males and one female in the prepared tank. Males will actively court the female, eventually resulting in the female beginning to deposit eggs. A dozen or so are released at a time with a maximum of only a couple hundred, usually far less. Promptly remove the adult fish once they finish laying eggs. In approximately 24 to 48 hours, the eggs will hatch; this will happen sooner if the water temperature is higher. Lighting should be kept very dim, as the fry are sensitive to light.%&07%After a few days, the fry will become free-swimming. Initially, they will feed on infusoria; move on to freshly hatched brine shrimp. If unable to provide infusoria, use a commercially prepared fry food, feeding them frequent small meals. As the fry grow, larger foods can be fed.%&07%There has been reported cross-breeding between this species and pearl danios, as well as other species of danio. However, the fry produced from these crosses are usually infertile.%&07%","fish, danio, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/dwarf%20spotted%20danio.png?alt=media&token=509d8aad-25fe-4008-bb41-ec64481d302f
Giant Danio Fish Species,The Spruce Pets,"The giant danio is a great addition to a large freshwater tank, especially if you're already raising larger fish such as cichlids. A schooling species, these large fish should always be kept in a sizeable group. As they zip around your aquarium you'll be impressed by their flashing scales and high energy. Like other members of this family, giant danios can be loyal to a single mate and remain with them for life.%&07%Species Overview%&07%COMMON NAME: Giant danio, golden giant danio%&07%SCIENTIFIC NAME: Devario aequipinnatus%&07%ADULT SIZE: 4 inches%&07%LIFE EXPECTANCY: 5+ years%&07%Characteristics%&07%Family-Cyprinidae%&07%Origin-India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand%&07%Social-Active, peaceful, schooling fish%&07%Tank Level-Mid and top dweller%&07%Minimum Tank Size-30 gallons%&07%Diet-Omnivorous, accepts all foods%&07%Breeding-Egg scatterers%&07%Care-Easy%&07%pH-6.8 to 7.5%&07%Hardness-To 20 dGH%&07%Temperature-72 to 75 F (22 to 24 C)%&07%Origin and Distribution%&07%The giant danio (Devario aequipinnatus) originated in the fast-running hill streams of India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and northern Thailand. Their natural habitat is clear water, whether it is in free-flowing streams or in the still, remnant ponds of the dry season. About 85 percent of all Indian exports of giant danios are wild-caught, but in the wild, the population is seen to be stable, by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species).%&07%The assigned genus of this fish has changed over the years, and it is common to see this species referred to just by the name Danio in the literature. The Malabar Danio (Devario malabaricus) was once considered the same species, but it has since been re-identified as a separate but closely related species.%&07%Colors and Markings%&07%Aptly named the giant danio, this deep-bodied species can reach four inches in length and even larger in its natural habitat. The body is iridescent gold with steel-blue-colored spots and stripes running lengthwise from the gills to the tail. The fins are pale golden in color and rounded, while the tail fin is forked. There are several color variations, including an albino.%&07%Tankmates%&07%Due to its size, the giant danio is not well suited to being kept with smaller fish. The rule of thumb is not to combine small fish with any fish large enough to swallow them. Small characins would be at risk, but medium to large characins may be suitable. Any medium- to large-sized bottom-dwelling fish will also do well with giant danios.%&07%Slow-moving fish, such as angelfish or bettas, are not suitable as tankmates with giant danios. These little giants make excellent additions to cichlid tanks, as long as the cichlid species you have are not overly aggressive. Giant danios should always be kept in a school of a half dozen at a minimum, preferably more. Smaller numbers often result in aggressive behavior toward other fish and even toward one another.%&07%Giant Danio Habitat and Care%&07%Giant danios are active and swim rapidly throughout the tank, preferring the upper levels of the aquarium. They are a schooling fish and should never be kept by themselves.%&07%The size and activity level of this species requires a roomy aquarium to provide sufficient swimming space. Although a 55-gallon tank is the recommended minimum size, it is possible to keep them in a 30- or 40-gallon tank if it is the long, horizontal variety. Any tank under 36 inches in length is simply too small to comfortably keep giant danios.%&07%Because they have a tendency to jump, keep the tank kept well covered at all times. Filtration should be sufficient to provide a steady flow of water and maintain good water quality. Decor to mimic a river or stream habitat is ideal but not required. To mimic their natural hill stream environment, use river gravel or sand, minimal driftwood, and sturdy plants, such as anubias, only along the periphery of the tank; leave the tank mostly open, with large, long areas for swimming.%&07%Giant Danio Diet and Feeding%&07%Giant danios are omnivorous and will accept a wide range of foods, including flake, freeze-dried, frozen, and live foods. To bring out the best coloration, offer live foods, such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, daphnia, or mosquito larvae. If live foods are not available, substitute the frozen counterpart. Occasionally include vegetable flakes in their feedings to provide a well-balanced diet.%&07% Collecting Live Food For Aquarium Fish%&07%Gender Differences%&07%Females are attractively colored but generally are less vivid than the males. The body is iridescent gold with steel-blue-colored spots and stripes running lengthwise from the gills to the tail. In females, the stripes bend upward at the base of the tail, while in males the stripe runs straight, extending through the tail. The abdomen of the female is fuller and rounder than that of the male. Males are also noticeably slimmer than their female counterparts.%&07%Breeding the Giant Danio%&07%Giant danios are relatively easy to breed, and the fry are fairly easy to raise. Spawning should be attempted in a roomy tank that has some exposure to the sun if possible, as natural sunlight triggers spawning. Keep the water warm, in the range of 77 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit (25 to 28 degrees Celsius), with a pH of 7.0 or below. Provide fine-leafed plants, such as java moss, or a spawning mop. Condition the breeder pair with live foods such as brine shrimp.%&07%During spawning, up to 20 eggs are produced during each pairing, which continues until as many as 300 are scattered on the plants or spawning mop. Remove the breeding pair once the eggs are laid, as the parents will consume the eggs and fry. Eggs hatch in 24 to 36 hours and the fry become free-swimming approximately 48 hours later. Feed the fry commercially prepared fine fry foods or freshly hatched brine shrimp.%&07%","fish, danio, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/giant%20danio.png?alt=media&token=8bf92be4-0f88-4683-be9f-94186db45bb0
Pearl Danio Fish Species,The Spruce Pets,"If you're new to aquariums or just looking to add a pretty, peaceful fish to your community tank, you can't go wrong with the pearl danio. This easy-going species is hardy, easy to care for, and gets along with just about any other peaceful fish. Its iridescent colors make it unusually attractive. The pearl danio thrives in a smaller 20-gallon tank and reproduces readily in captivity.%&07%Species Overview%&07%COMMON NAMES: Pearl danio, spotted danio%&07%SCIENTIFIC NAME: Danio albolineatus%&07%ADULT SIZE: 2 inches (6 cm)%&07%LIFE EXPECTANCY: 5 years%&07%Characteristics%&07%Family-Cyprinidae%&07%Origin-Burma, Sumatra, Thailand%&07%Social-Peaceful schooling fish%&07%Tank Level-All%&07%Minimum Tank Size-20 gallons%&07%Diet-Omnivore, eats most foods%&07%Breeding-Egglayer%&07%Care-Easy%&07%pH-6.5 to 7.0%&07%Hardness-5 to 12 dGH%&07%Temperature-64 to 75 F (18 to 24 C)%&07%Origin and Distribution%&07%Initially imported in Europe in 1911, this species has been a popular fish in the aquarium industry ever since. They originate from clear, swiftly moving streams and rivers in Myanmar (formerly known as Burma), Thailand, and Sumatra. In nature, they feed primarily on insects and zooplankton.%&07%This fish has several scientific names, a few of which were initially assigned to what were later determined to be color variants of the same species. Debate still exists over the classification of these differences in coloration. At one time this species was classified under the Brachydanio genus, which has since been declared invalid. The scientific name Danio albolineatus means white-lined danio.%&07%The name of this fish should not be confused with the celestial pearl danio, also known as the galaxy rasbora, Danio margaritatus, which is a dark-colored danio sporting red or orange fins and white spots on the body.%&07%Colors and Markings%&07%The iridescent colors this fish is named for make it one of the most attractive of the freshwater fish. Its pearly, blue-violet hued body is accented by an orange-red stripe running from tail to mid-body. Males are smaller, slimmer, and more colorful, often showing a red tint along the ventral aspect. A yellow-ochre color variant, known as the yellow danio, is available in some locations. Pearl danios have a forked tail and two sets of paired barbels.%&07%Tankmates%&07%Pearl danios are peaceful and well-suited for community aquariums and get along with any peaceful fish. They are tolerant of a wide range of water conditions, which also makes them suited to combining with a variety of other fish. Like others of the danio family, pearls live in schools and should be kept in groups of at least five to eight, and preferably more. Males will show their best colors if there is at least one female present.%&07%Pearl Danio Habitat and Care%&07%Originating from fast-moving streams and rivers, the pearl danio is accustomed to strong water currents. Because they require a slightly higher oxygen level than other danios, good filtration is important. Pearl danios tolerate colder temperatures well and may even be kept in an unheated aquarium. They swim at all levels, but due to their propensity for jumping, the tank should be well covered.%&07%An extremely hardy and easy-to-care-for fish, pearl danios make an excellent beginner fish. As they require ample swimming room, longer tanks are preferable, with plants along the back and sides. Their iridescent colors are most visible under reflected, overhead lighting, and they are particularly fond of early-morning sunlight. Although undemanding about water parameters, they do best in neutral (pH 7.0) water that is soft to slightly hard.%&07%Pearl Danio Diet and Feeding%&07%Pearl danios will accept all types of live, frozen, and flake food. In nature, their diet consists primarily of insects and zooplankton. To maintain health, feed good quality tropical flake or granulated food, as well as frozen and live foods such as tubifex, mosquito larvae, brine shrimp, and daphnia.%&07%Feeding Your Fish Live Food%&07%Gender Differences%&07%Male and female pearl danios are similar in appearance. The biggest difference is that, when full of eggs, the female will have a more rounded body shape. It is not unusual for females to be more robust than the males, as the females are larger overall, and fuller-bodied. Males are smaller, slimmer, and more brightly colored. The males often show a red tint along the ventral aspect.%&07%Breeding the Pearl Danio%&07%Pearl danios are an easy-to-breed egg-laying fish. As with other danios, when breeding pairs form they are very loyal. The breeding tank should be warm, 79 to 86°F (26 to 30°C), and the water level kept shallow, about 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm). Fine-leaved plants should be provided, either floating or planted in a group. Marbles make an excellent substrate that will allow stray eggs to fall out of the reach of hungry adult fish. A breeding grid or mop on the bottom would also suffice to protect eggs.%&07%Pearl danios will spawn as pairs or in a school. Half as many females as males should be placed in the breeding tank several days before introducing the males. Once the males are added, pairs will form and leave the group to scatter eggs.%&07%Spawning can also be initiated by adding a small amount of water every few hours so that the tank is gradually topped up; this simulates the rainy season of the natural habitat. Pairs will spawn the next morning. The easiest and quickest way to tell is to look at the female; if the fish have spawned she will be noticeably slimmer. Remove the adults as soon as spawning is completed, otherwise, they will consume their eggs.%&07%Keep the tank dark while the eggs develop, to prevent fungal growth. The fry will emerge in 36 to 48 hours and should be fed freshly hatched brine shrimp or infusoria. Young danios grow rapidly and will be free-swimming in six to seven days. Fry may be raised on finely ground dry food or commercially prepared fried food.%&07%","fish, danio, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/pearl%20danio.png?alt=media&token=6522b1dd-da1d-4b5e-8a0c-e5df038e5fa3
Zebra Danio (Zebrafish) Fish Species,The Spruce Pets,"Zebra danios are a favorite of freshwater fish hobbyists because of their ease of care. They are also prolific breeders and the easiest type of egg layers to breed. With their attractively striped, black and white zebra-patterned bodies, these fish are easy to recognize. Zebrafish are very durable and can withstand an impressive range of water temperatures and conditions. They will generally do just fine without a water heater as they are comfortable at temperatures down to the low 60s F.%&07%Species Overview%&07%COMMON NAMES: Striped danio, zebra danio, zebrafish%&07%SCIENTIFIC NAME: Danio rerio%&07%ADULT SIZE: 2 inches%&07%LIFE EXPECTANCY: 5 years%&07%Characteristics%&07%Family-Cyprinidae%&07%Origin-Eastern India%&07%Social-Peaceful, suitable for community tanks%&07%Tank Level-All levels%&07%Minimum Tank Size-10 gallon%&07%Diet-Omnivore%&07%Breeding-Egglayer%&07%Care-Easy%&07%pH-6.5 to 7.0%&07%Hardness-5 to 12 dGH%&07%Temperature-64 to 74 F (18 to 24 C)%&07%Origin and Distribution%&07%Zebra danios were originally thought to have originated from a wider range that stretched from Myanmar in the east and Pakistan in the west; however, the current consensus is that this species originates from a much narrower range that is confined to parts of India and Bangladesh.%&07%Part of this change in distribution is due to the identification of similar species that were once misidentified as being Danio rerio. Damage to the environment that resulted in a reduction of habitable areas has also narrowed their natural range, even though wild zebra danios utilize a variety of habitats, ranging from fast-moving streams to slow-moving, nearly stagnant ponds.%&07%Zebra danios available in the aquarium industry are now almost always captive-bred as zebras are easy and inexpensive to raise. While commercial breeding has provided a large and unlimited supply of this species, it has also resulted in a fish that is less robust than the original wild species. Many varieties of zebra danios are available now at your local aquarium store.%&07%Colors and Markings%&07%The zebra danio is easily recognized by its distinctive horizontal stripes. Blue-purple horizontal stripes run from gill to tail, setting off the slim, compressed, silver-gold body of this attractive fish.%&07%Albino, golden, veil-tailed, and long-finned zebra danio varieties are available, as well as a popular leopard variety. The leopard strain is characterized by a sprinkling of black spots over the entire body. In the past, the leopard danio was considered a different species, but genetic studies have proven that it is merely a spotted variation of Danio rerio.%&07%A brightly colored variety of zebra danio is now available called GloFish. These fish have had fluorescent pigment introduced into their DNA that makes them brightly colored. They still have the dark stripes but the body color is now orange, green, blue, purple or red.%&07%Tankmates%&07%The small size of the zebra danio, no more than two inches, makes them well suited to a community aquarium. Zebra danios are peaceful fish that get along with most tankmates, however, they will nip fins of some species. Any fish with long-flowing fins, such as angelfish, bettas, and guppies, are potential targets of the active zebra danio. Good potential tankmates may include similar-sized danios, barbs, corydoras catfish, tetras, loaches, mollies, platys and swordtails.%&07%All varieties thrive in schools and should never be kept as singles. They do best when kept in a school of five or more of their own kind. Groups of this fish can be hierarchal, and a pecking order may emerge in the school, but there is no fighting. Select tankmates that are similar in temperament and that can keep up with the fast-paced behavior of this danio. Mellower fish that need a less hectic environment can become stressed in their presence.%&07%Zebra Danio Habitat and Care%&07%Zebras are primarily surface-dwelling fish that favor moving waters. Technically considered a cold-water fish, this fish prefers water in the 64 to 75 F range. However, they will adapt to a wide range of water conditions. If water temperatures are kept too low, they tend to become more susceptible to disease.%&07%Zebras are extremely active, and although they have a preference for the upper levels of the aquarium, they will move throughout the entire tank. Provide them with diffuse lighting and an open swimming space with vegetation around the periphery of the habitat. A darker color substrate will help showcase the color of these fish and give the habitat a more natural feel.%&07%Zebra Danio Diet and Feeding%&07%Zebra danios are omnivorous, accepting almost any food. Although undemanding in diet, they particularly enjoy small, live, or frozen invertebrates and fresh vegetable matter. They can be fed small pelleted food or flake fish food for their main diet, with supplements of freeze dried bring shrimp or tubifex worms, or frozen foods.%&07% Is Your Fish Omnivore, Herbivore or Carnivore?%&07%Gender Differences%&07%Both sexes have two pairs of barbels and the same stripes, but females are usually larger. Males are a bit smaller and more slender than females. Male zebras appear more torpedo-shaped, while females tend to have a larger belly. More full-bodied than the males, a female's belly balloons when it fills with eggs.%&07%Breeding the Zebra Danio %&07%Zebra danios are ideal for beginners as they are prolific breeders, and interestingly females can spawn every two to three days after reaching sexual maturity at about four months. The best way to obtain a mating pair is to start with a school of a half dozen or more young zebras and allow and watch for the females to develop rounded bellies. When the females are full of eggs, separate one or two females and two to four males into a separate breeding tank.%&07%Set up a separate breeding tank with shallow water, approximately six inches deep. Furnish the tank with fine-leafed plants. The bottom needs to be covered with a coarse substrate such as marbles or large gravel/pebbles so that the eggs will fall between the substrate pieces and will be protected from the adult fish, which will readily eat their own eggs once they lay them. A wide-mesh breeding net holding the adults can also be suspended in the tank. The mesh needs to be large enough for the eggs to fall through the netting, without letting the parents out.%&07%When preparing to breed them, providing a water change can help induce spawning. Spawning requires temperatures of up to 78 to 80 F and can be triggered by raising the water a few degrees near dawn, when spawning normally occurs. About 300 to 500 eggs will be scattered across the bottom and on the plants. Remove breeders after spawning, as they will also consume the young as they hatch.%&07%The fry will hatch in about two days, depending on water temperature. The fry are very tiny and can easily be lost when changing water, so take care when maintaining the nursery tank. A sponge filter is best to use in the breeding/nursery tank so the babies do not get sucked into the filter. Feed the young commercially prepared fry food or finely crushed flake foods. You can also add a powdered egg to fry food to promote growth. Be sure not to overfeed as uneaten food will foul the water quickly.%&07%","fish, danio, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/zebra%20danio.png?alt=media&token=b99fb5f2-2df6-42a2-a010-93fd7d955fab
Danio Behavior,The Spruce Pets,"Danios are social fish that exhibit shoaling behavior. Many danio shoals have hierarchical systems. The most dominant fish in the shoal establish their leadership through playful behaviors.%&07%In an under-populated or over-cramped tank, danios are known to show more aggressive behaviors than usual, such as chasing and nipping the fins of their less-dominant peers. This can be avoided by buying the right number of danios and placing the fish in the right-sized tank.%&07%Advertisements%&07%Danios are peaceful, but the fish show signs of aggression to slow-moving, long-finned fish. Don’t house danios with slow-moving fish to prevent fin-nipping.%&07%Housing danios alone can stress the fish and lead to lethargy and illness. Keeping danios in shoals of around six to twelve will prevent this issue. Danios become hyperactive in large shoals, so don’t buy too many danios for your aquarium.%&07%Danios occupy the top, middle, and bottom sections of the aquarium, but these fish predominantly reside in the middle to upper layers.%&07%Tank Mates%&07%Before you consider housing danios with any other fish species, make sure you have enough danios in your shoal. Danios become stressed when kept on their own, and you should house these fish in groups of at least five (one male to four females).%&07%Advertisements%&07%Danios school with their own species. For instance, in the wild, zebra danios will swim with celestial pearl danios if there aren’t enough fish of their kind to shoal with.%&07%Danios are compatible with other types of danios, so consider adding different danio species to your tank before you look for other fish.%&07%%&07%Some of the other fish that can be housed with danios are:%&07%	Honey gouramis — Inexperienced fishkeepers should consider adding honey gouramis to their community tank. Honey gouramis are peaceful, shy fish that are easy to care for and can be kept in pairs or groups. Although honey gouramis aren’t schooling fish, these fish enjoy one another’s company.%&07%	Scarlet badis —A popular breed of nano fish is the scarlet badis. This freshwater fish is tiny, and the males grow to no larger than eight-tenths of an inch. Full-sized females reach half an inch in length. Scarlet badis are peaceful fish that hide in plants and avoid big fish.%&07%	Ember tetras — Sometimes known as fire tetras, ember tetras are eye-catching fish that aren’t easily scared. These active, playful fish usually swim in the mid-section of the tank. Ember tetras are shoaling fish and exhibit peaceful, cautious behavior.%&07%	Rosy barbs — Active fish with bright colors and peaceful temperaments, rosy barbs are one of the larger members of the barb species. These fish make great community fish, but, like danios, rosy barbs have a tendency for fin-nipping and shouldn’t be housed with slow-moving, long-finned fish.%&07%	Rummy nose tetras —Three similar fish species are classed as rummy nose tetras, but the true rummy nose tetra is the Hemigrammus rhodostomus. Rummy nose tetras are peaceful shoaling fish that enjoy having plenty of swimming space.%&07%	Corydoras — These small, tropical freshwater catfish are peaceful schooling fish that do well in groups of 6 or more. Corydoras are shy fish that scavenge for food at the bottom of the tank and prefer stable water parameters.%&07%	Dojo loaches — Also known as pond loaches or weather loaches, dojo loaches are bottom-dwelling tank cleaners that spend most of their waking hours eating algae. Hardy and peaceful, dojo loaches do best when housed in small groups.%&07%	Aquatic invertebrates —Snail species, like zebra snails, are peaceful tankmates for danios, and help to keep the tank clean. Freshwater shrimp, like the blue velvet shrimp, are other compatible aquatic invertebrates. You can also house danios with frogs, such as the African dwarf frog.%&07%There are several fish that shouldn’t be housed with danios, including long-finned, slow-moving fish, like elephant ear guppies and sailfin molly fish. Danios will nip the fins of these fish. Predatory fish like redtail catfish shouldn’t be housed with danios, as these fish are known to view danios as food.%&07%","fish, danio, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20fish.png?alt=media&token=3e7020a9-4066-47b6-9be3-66d171b840be
Danio’s Common Diseases,The Spruce Pets,"Most fish diseases that affect danios can be avoided by maintaining high-quality tank conditions.%&07%Some of the diseases that are common to danio fish include:%&07%Mycobacteriosis%&07%Mycobacteriosis is a disease caused by various species of mycobacteria. This disease inflames the organs of danios, leading to a change in skin pigment, a loss of scales, and weight loss. Treat mycobacteriosis with antibiotics. Prevent bacterial contamination by regularly cleaning the tank, and quarantine affected fish to prevent the disease from spreading.%&07%Velvet%&07%Velvet is caused by a pathogen called oodinium. Danios infected by this pathogen will display yellowish dust substances on their bodies. Other symptoms of velvet are loss of appetite, weight loss, and scratching against objects in the fish tank. The fish’s skin will eventually start to peel off.%&07%To treat velvet, dim the lights in the tank for several days and add aquarium salt to the water. Raise the water temperature to 82°F to speed up the life cycle of the pathogen.%&07%Ich%&07%Ich, or ichthyophthirius multifiliis, is one of the most common aquarium diseases, affecting most species of fish. This disease is caused by protozoan parasites and is characterized by white spots on fins, gills, and the body of the fish.%&07%A fish with ich will scratch against the walls of the tank. Other symptoms of ich include a loss of appetite and weight loss.%&07%To treat ich, increase the water temperature by a couple of degrees and use anti-parasitic medication.%&07%%&07%Swim Bladder Disorder%&07%Swim bladder disorder affects the functioning of the danio’s swim bladder. Fish need the right amount of air in the swim bladder to move upward and downward. A fish with swim bladder disorder will swim awkwardly, sometimes swimming upside-down.%&07%Swim bladder is caused by poor water quality or a sudden temperature change. Parasitic and bacterial infections can also cause the stomach to swell.%&07%Treat swim bladder by maintaining a water temperature of 78–80°F and not feeding the affected fish for three days.%&07%","fish, danio, diseases",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20fish.png?alt=media&token=3e7020a9-4066-47b6-9be3-66d171b840be
How to Take Care of Goldfish,The Spruce Pets,"Despite popular opinion, goldfish are not ""maintenance-free"" or ""trial"" pets. They require and deserve just as much care as any other pet. Goldfish are hardy species and good at tolerating many beginner's mistakes, but you will need to put in some effort to ensure their health and survival. They should not be kept in a fishbowl but require an aquarium with proper water aeration and filtration.%&07%Types of Goldfish%&07%There are many different varieties of goldfish. They are commonly divided into standard (long-body) and fancy (round body) varieties. The common Comet Goldfish is the most common pet fish species. Although they are often sold in the pets stores very small, these fish can grow up to 14 to 16 inches long and may require up to 100 gallons at their full size. Shubunkin and Sarasa goldfish varieties have the same body type, but are often more colorful fish, with combinations of red, white, black, and yellow colors.%&07%Fancy varieties of goldfish are numerous and have many anatomical adaptations. These breeds include the Oranda, Ranchu, Telescope, Fantail, Celestial, Moor, and other varieties. They have egg-shaped or rounded bodies. Given their body structure, they usually do not grow as large as long-body goldfish and may have some structural issues. These fish are more prone to buoyancy issues, spinal disease, and traumatic injury due to their protruding eyes and delicate fins. The Oranda goldfish has a fleshy growth on its head, called a wen, that may even need trimming if it overgrows the fish’s eyes or face.%&07%How Long Do Goldfish Live?%&07%When you first bring home your goldfish, how long can you expect them to live? Is a 6-or-7-year-old goldfish dying from old age? Absolutely not. For most comet goldfish, you can expect at least 20 years, with the world record goldfish living for 42 years! Most of the time, as they get larger, goldfish start to get too large for a small aquarium, resulting in poor water quality and stress. This frequently results in secondary illness due to decreased immune function from chronic stress. To take proper care of your goldfish in their later years, be prepared for 30 gallons or more per fish. With proper care, goldfish can easily live a long and healthy life.%&07%Fancy vs. Standard Goldfish%&07%There are a wide variety of goldfish in the pet industry. With round bodies, protruding eyeballs and ornate fins, fancy varieties of goldfish can be quite elaborate. To obtain these unique individuals, many generations of goldfish have been cross bred. This has led to fancy goldfish having shorter life spans than standard comet goldfish. Most fancy varieties of goldfish should live into their teens, but 20 years is not common.%&07%What Can You Do to Help Lengthen Lifespan?%&07%To help your goldfish live a long and happy life, proper care of goldfish comes down to providing them the correct environment and diet. These will both change as your goldfish gets older and grows larger.%&07%Correct Environment%&07%All fish may start small, but many goldfish have the potential to grow as large as a dinner plate! Contrary to popular belief, goldfish do not “grow to the size of their container.” Starting your goldfish in a 20-gallon tank (that’s per fish!) will work for the first few years, but plan on upgrading them as they grow over the years.%&07%Goldfish are hungry fish and do not convert their food into mass very well, so they produce a lot of waste. This waste ends up in their aquarium water, causing water quality issues that require frequent cleaning. When fish are swimming in gross water, their immune system does not work well, and the fish will get sick from secondary infections from environmental bacteria and any lingering parasites. This is the most common cause of goldfish death that is commonly attributed to “old age,” when it has to do with your fish’s limited space and poor water quality.%&07%Diet and Feeding%&07%There are a wide variety of goldfish diets on the pet store shelves. Often, owners are overwhelmed with options and settle on flashy packaging or pricing to guide their decisions, neither of which has any influence on food quality. When it comes to goldfish diets, owner’s should pay attention to the protein and fat content of the diet that is listed on the label. Goldfish require approximately 30% protein for proper body maintenance. Growing juveniles will require more protein, around 35-45%. Fat requirements for goldfish are low due to their limited activity. For maintenance, your goldfish will require around 6% fat, with young fish and reproductively-active fish requiring around 10% fat in the diet.%&07%Flake diets are only for tiny fish. Once your goldfish can eat a pellet, they should be switched over from flakes to pellets. Goldfish pellets come in very small sizes these days, so size is not an excuse to keep feeding your fish flakes. Pellets retain their nutrition significantly better than flakes due to their lower surface-to-mass ratio. Your fish may not like the switch because flakes smell and taste better than pellets. Use some tough love and tell your fish it’s better for their overall health, not to mention less waste for you to clean! Remember to replace your container of fish food every six months to maintain good vitamin content.%&07%Geriatric Goldfish Care%&07%Once your goldfish reaches “geriatric” age in their late teens and early 20s—or early teens for fancy varieties—you can expect to see some changes in their behavior. As they get older, expect your goldfish to not swim as much and take extended rest periods on the bottom of their aquarium. You will need to keep their water quality and tank clean to support them in their later years. Some goldfish may start to eat a little less, but this is not common. Older goldfish may be more selective about their diet, so offering a variety of pellets may be required to maintain their nutrition. Do not just feed them treats, such as dried or frozen shrimp. All fish require a well-rounded diet that most pellets can provide, made from a mix of proteins and veggies.%&07%Overall, goldfish are one of the most long-lived pet species, so a death at less than 10 years old is usually not age-related. More often, as they grow, goldfish max out their space and resources. What is appropriate for a small goldfish will not be the same for life. Adjust the aquarium size and filtration as your pet goldfish grows to provide a proper habitat for a long and happy life.%&07%Environmental Requirements%&07%No matter what variety of goldfish you keep, maintaining a proper aquatic environment is critical. You will need at least 20 gallons of water per goldfish and expect your long-body goldfish to outgrow this within the first 5 to 10 years. Comet goldfish can easily live into their 20s and some have lived over 40 years, with the fancy varieties usually surviving into their mid-teens.%&07%Most goldfish are very tolerant of beginner water quality mistakes. They are a very hardy species and can tolerate moderate levels of ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate in circulating tanks. Once your aquarium nitrogen cycle has been established, it is recommended to keep your nitrate less than 20 mg/L, and the ammonia and nitrite at zero. In densely packed tanks, this may be hard to maintain without frequent water changes. Goldfish are notorious for constantly eating and creating a lot of waste—hence the spatial needs. They can also tolerate a wide range of pH, provided your kH is high enough to stabilize the pH levels.%&07%Goldfish are natural foragers and may spend most of their time digging around in the substrate of their aquarium or pond looking for food. They like to suck every morsel out of their meals and will often pick up small rocks in their mouth to clean off food particles. These have a very low chance of getting stuck in their mouth, so don't worry about your fish picking them up.%&07%","fish, goldfish, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20fish.png?alt=media&token=3e7020a9-4066-47b6-9be3-66d171b840be

These have a very low chance of getting stuck in their mouth, so don't worry about your fish picking them up.%&07%Housing Goldfish Outdoors%&07%In addition to indoor aquariums, goldfish can also be kept in outdoor ponds. Their hardiness makes it easy for them to stand up against temperature changes throughout the days and seasons. Provided your pond is large enough and properly built, your goldfish may enjoy spending all their time outside, or, in colder climates, splitting their time between outdoors and indoors. Outdoor ponds should have at least 30 gallons of water per goldfish and should have aeration and a filtration system. The water depth should be a minimum of 3-4 feet, deeper in colder climates.%&07%It is not recommended to put fancy goldfish varieties in large, outdoor ponds. They are not well set up to swim large distances and the increased depth can put additional pressure on their swim bladder, augmenting buoyancy disorders. Due to their poorer swimming ability, they cannot compete with comet goldfish or koi for food, and they are more prone to predator attacks.%&07%What Size is Best for a Goldfish Tank?%&07%A pet goldfish is one of the most common species kept by beginner fish owners. However, what starts as a small fish can easily grow to a dinner-plate size behemoth. What tank size is best for goldfish and how should you plan accordingly for their large, adult size?%&07%What size is best for a goldfish aquarium?%&07%First, decide how many goldfish you want to keep. Goldfish do just fine as only children, so you can start with one, or keep two, three, or more. Keep in mind that the more fish you have, the more room they will need. When they are only a few inches long, you can get away with 20 gallons per fish. Yes, this rules out bowls, 5 gallon, and 10 gallon tanks.%&07%Why so big? Goldfish are messy fish with large appetites and low feed to mass conversion. That means that with the food they eat, they produce a lot of ammonia. Ammonia is the primary nitrogenous waste in fish and the beginning of the nitrogen cycle. Since goldfish produce a lot of ammonia, having more water to dilute this out makes a big difference in the overall health of your goldfish. If ammonia builds up in the water it can stress or even kill the fish.%&07%And a 20-gallon tank is just to start! As the fish grow, expect to upgrade to a 50, 75, or even 100-gallon tank for one goldfish. Standard comet goldfish can grow up to 16 inches long—the same size as a dinner plate—and they will need lots of room to swim. Fancy goldfish varieties do not get as large and if they have difficulty swimming, may not need such a dramatic tank upgrade.%&07%What do goldfish need in their aquarium%&07%Goldfish require a large swimming space and lots of filtration. If you have a standard, long-body goldfish, such as a Comet, Sarasa or Shubunkin, your filtration should be slightly larger than what is recommended for the tank size. Remember, goldfish produce a lot of waste, so excess filtration is a great benefit. However, many fancy varieties of goldfish are not great swimmers, so excessive currents from strong filters can easily cause them stress. Baffling or redirecting filter outflows to the longest angle of your tank is best at providing adequate filtration without excessive water currents.%&07%Your tank should be long enough for your fish to swim comfortably and turn around without difficulty. You can have artificial decorations, provided they do not impede your fish's ability to swim or turn around. Keep in mind that any caves may be quickly outgrown as your fish grows.%&07%You can keep live plants with goldfish but be sure to quarantine them properly. If they come from aquarium systems with other fish, they could also potentially bring in bacteria and parasites. A two-week quarantine in a tank containing no fish will break parasite life cycles. Use this time to beef up your new plants with a bit of aquarium plant fertilizer. Don't get too attached to your plants, however, since goldfish are notorious redecorators and plant eaters.%&07%How do you know if your goldfish needs a bigger tank?%&07%Goldfish do not grow only to the size of their container. Terrible water quality and ancient flake diets have perpetuated this myth for far too long. In an appropriate environment and with a good quality diet, expect your fish to reach full size within a few years.%&07%The most prevalent indicator of a goldfish that has outgrown the tank is poor water quality. You may see nitrite or ammonia in an established aquarium, indicating that your filtration cannot keep up with your fish's waste production. You can add more filtration temporarily, but a bigger tank is a much better permanent fix.%&07%Another sign of a goldfish running out of room is difficulty turning around. Some fish may develop spinal curvature from small tanks. In shallow tanks, a fish's tail hitting the bottom during feeding time is another sign that it's time for a larger tank. Thankfully, once you move the fish to a new, bigger tank, the spinal issues will likely resolve, if the fish has not been in the old tank for too long.%&07%Bruises and missing scales are another sign that your fish is running out of room. In the interim, before you purchase a new tank, you can buy some time by removing décor items from the tank and giving your fish more room to swim.%&07%Tips to Maintain Goldfish at Current Size%&07%To preserve your fish at their current size in their current tank, it is critical for you to pay special attention to their diet. Diets high in protein will cause your fish to grow big faster than if they were on a lower protein diet. Overfeeding a low protein diet can also lead to rapid growth.%&07%The best feeding practice for goldfish is to feed a pelleted diet between 30-35% protein. Depending on the water temperature, your fish will require once or twice a day feeding. If the temperature is below 74F (23C), feed your fish once a day. Above this, feed twice a day. The warmer the water is, the faster your fish's metabolism and the more calories they will burn swimming around.%&07%During feeding time, feed your fish a few pellets at a time. Allow them to consume all the pellets before adding a few more. Most goldfish will slow down or stop eating after a few rounds of light feeding or a few minutes. After this, stop feeding. Always watch your fish carefully while feeding rather than dumping the food in and walking away. Feeding time is a great way to check out your fish's behavior and appetite—a good time to assess if anything may be wrong.%&07%","fish, goldfish, general, shelter",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20fish.png?alt=media&token=3e7020a9-4066-47b6-9be3-66d171b840be
Feeding Goldfish,The Spruce Pets,"How Much and How Often to Feed Goldfish%&07%Goldfish are often compared to Golden Retrievers for their similar appetites and ability to gorge themselves. They love to eat and, depending on the temperature of their water, may seem almost insatiable. No matter what fish species you keep, since they are ectotherms, the warmer the water, the hungrier your fish will be. With water temperatures below 70F (21C), feed your goldfish at least once a day. Above this, you will need to feed your goldfish twice a day. Give the fish as much food as they will eat in 3-5 minutes.%&07%Look for a goldfish diet around 30-35% protein and 5-7% fat. For reproductively active, breeding fish or juveniles, you will need to select a diet higher in protein and fat. There are many commercial diets available within this range for goldfish. Weekly protein-rich treats, such as bloodworms or brine shrimp, are appropriate only in warmer water. Shelled green peas, not actually a cure for ""constipation,"" are a better treat to feed more often.%&07%Fancy goldfish and their buoyancy disorders can be related to diet. Being voracious surface eaters, a goldfish may suck in too much air during feeding and become temporarily positively buoyant. Switching to a sinking diet, or vice versa for negatively buoyant fish, will take advantage of their physostomous anatomy, where the gas bladder is connected to their digestive tract at the pharynx, and correct the buoyancy disorder without veterinary intervention.%&07%What Food Is Healthy For Goldfish?%&07%When it comes to deciding what to feed your goldfish, there are many options on the pet store shelves. But how do you know which is the best for your fish?%&07%Before you grab whatever package looks best on the fish store shelves, you need to take a close look at the ingredient label. All pet food labels contain a guaranteed analysis statement and list of ingredients. If you cannot find these on the package of goldfish food, do not buy it.%&07%The guaranteed analysis is a measurement of the various macro-nutrients in a food product. By U.S. law, fish foods are required to list the percentage of moisture, protein, fat, fiber, and phosphorus. Any additional listings are at the discretion of the company.%&07%Ingredients are listed by the highest percentage in a diet to the smallest amount. Some companies list out specific vitamins and minerals, while others will list these as a ""vitamin premix."" Both are valid.%&07%What should I look for in goldfish food?%&07%When choosing a food for your goldfish, follow these guidelines:%&07%Pellets vs. Flakes%&07%It is always best to feed your goldfish pellets, rather than flakes. Pellets come in various sizes, so you will likely find one that is appropriate for the size of your fish. Flakes have a higher surface area to mass ratio, meaning they will float better than pellets, but goldfish that eat food at the surface may ingest air, and round bodied goldfish such as Oranda’s may develop floating disorders. Pellets tend to slowly sink, and your goldfish can eat them while they drop and will even eat them off the bottom of the aquarium. If you do use flake foods for your goldfish, you can hold the pinch of food under the water surface to release it, so the goldfish eat it while it is falling, rather than floating at the surface.%&07%Fish food should be kept in sealed containers in a cool environment and used within one to six months of purchasing the food container. If kept longer, the vitamin content may decrease in the food. Flake food may spoil faster than pelleted food and lose moisture. Water-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin C—which is critical for proper immune function—decrease faster in flakes than in pellets. If you store fish food in the refrigerator or freezer it will keep fresh longer. Do not leave food out in the sunshine or at high temperatures if using it for pond fish.%&07%Protein%&07%Protein is the main source of energy for fish. Carbohydrates are not well processed and a diet high in carbohydrates can lead to liver damage. For goldfish, a maintenance level of around 30% is recommended based on current research.1 Juvenile goldfish and those individuals involved in breeding should be fed a higher level, around 35%.%&07%Feeding a higher protein diet will lead to fast growing fish and lots of nitrogenous waste. Despite common myths, goldfish do not ""grow to the size of their container,"" and rather are stunted due to poor diet and water quality. Your goldfish can easily outgrow their small tank on a high protein diet. Lots of protein in the diet leads to additional ammonia production, which can seriously impact your aquarium or pond's nitrogen cycle. Goldfish should start in an aquarium of at least 20 gallons but will likely need more room as they grow.%&07%It is also critical to count the number of protein sources in an ingredient list on the food label. This may take some extra research on your part, but higher quality diets will have fewer protein sources. Fish require from their diet ten essential amino acids (arginine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine) in order to live. This may take just a few protein sources to supply, usually from fish or shrimp meal, or if other protein sources are used, some amino acids may need to be supplemented. If you see any amino acids listed by their pure form, usually ""L-"" or ""DL-,"" this indicates the usage of cheap protein sources. There is nothing wrong with these diets, just don't shell out top dollar for lower quality protein in the food.%&07%Fat%&07%Unless your fish is a growing juvenile or an adult actively making baby fishes, they do not have a high fat requirement. Rapidly growing fish use oils over protein or carbohydrates as their primary energy source. The fat in the diet should be supplied by unsaturated fats, usually fish oil. Anything higher than 5-8% fat in the food is not necessary for adult goldfish and significantly higher levels can impact liver function.%&07%Fiber%&07%Fiber is the carbohydrate portion of fish food. Fish do not utilize much carbohydrate in their natural diet. A goldfish's digestive system is not acidic like ours, so their ability to digest fiber is extremely limited. High fiber is of no benefit to your fish and should be avoided. Usual amounts of fiber in the fish food should be no more than 20-30%.%&07%How Often Should I Feed My Goldfish?%&07%How often you feed your goldfish is dictated by your aquarium water temperature. Most goldfish aquariums will hover around 72-76 degrees Fahrenheit (22-24C) in a typical home, unless you live in a colder area, or use an aquarium heater in your tank. Goldfish do NOT require a heater and too warm of water temperature may excessively increase metabolism. The ideal water temperature for goldfish is 68-75 F (20-24 C), but they can live in a wider temperature range than that.%&07%General guidelines for goldfish feedings per day are relatively flexible. In the lower 70s and down into the 60s (less than 23 Celsius), feed your goldfish once per day. Above this, you should feed twice a day. Do not feed more than your fish can eat in a few minutes. Sprinkle very small amounts and once that has been completely consumed, sprinkle a little more for up to 3-5 minutes at each feeding.%&07%How Do I Know If My Goldfish is Overfed?%&07%Goldfish are prone to obesity like many other pets. However, an overfed goldfish can be hard to differentiate. Body condition scoring is a common method of determining if a pet is overweight. While there are good standards for other fish, such as zebrafish, there is no set standard for goldfish.2%&07%Using the zebrafish research, a simple goldfish obesity test can be applied. Looking down at your goldfish, their head and pectoral girdle should be the widest part of their body and then taper gradually to the tail. If your goldfish gets wider right behind their pectoral fins, they may be overweight. However, this may be normal for a reproductively active female goldfish. Fat vs. eggs can be easily determined on ultrasound. Also, round bodied goldfish varieties always look fat in the middle!%&07%What Can Happen If Your Overfeed Your Goldfish%&07%If you overfeed your goldfish, they are at risk of obesity, and may quickly outgrow their aquarium and it will create water quality issues. Obesity causes strain on internal organs, as it does in other pets. Thankfully, fish must continuously swim, decreasing the risk, but it is still a concern.%&07%As stated previously, overfeeding can quickly increase the size of your fish and cause them to need tank upgrades relatively quickly. This can also lead to an increase in ammonia output and strain your beneficial bacteria in the biofilter that manages the nitrogen cycle. And high ammonia can lead to fish health issues and death.%&07%Goldfish Maintenance Requirements%&07%Although they are tolerant of beginner's mistakes, goldfish aquariums and ponds require regular maintenance. You will need to properly clean your filters on a weekly basis, but do not replace them all at once, as you may lose the necessary bacteria in them that break down fish waste. Use a gravel siphon at least once a week to remove the debris and detritus from your substrate and top off your tank with conditioned fresh water.%&07%As with all fish systems, it is highly recommended to purchase a liquid-based water quality test kit to maintain good water chemistry. Check it before and after your water changes to keep a close eye on the water quality in your goldfish aquarium.%&07%","fish, goldfish, general, nutrient",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20fish.png?alt=media&token=3e7020a9-4066-47b6-9be3-66d171b840be
Bubble Eye Goldfish: Fish Species,The Spruce Pets,"Is that goldfish holding his breath underwater? Although it may look like that, the bubble eye goldfish has been bred to have very large sacs of fluid under their eyes. This benign fluid pocket predisposes these fish to eye trauma, so careful consideration to aquarium setup, décor, and tank mates must be given to these fish.%&07%Species Overview%&07%COMMON NAME: Bubble Eye Goldfish%&07%SCIENTIFIC NAME: Carassius auratus%&07%ADULT SIZE: 6 inches%&07%LIFE EXPECTANCY: 6 to 15 years%&07%WARNING%&07%Given the bubble eye goldfish's delicate eye structures, there is a fair amount of concern for their welfare and wellbeing within the aquarium community. Please carefully consider if these fish are a good fit for your tank and fish lifestyle. The bubble eye goldfish are slow swimming fish that cannot easily see in front of them and are prone to injuring their delicate eye tissues. They should not be housed with fish that are aggressive or that might nip at their bubble eyes.%&07%%&07%Characteristics%&07%Family-Cyprinidae %&07%Origin-Asia %&07%Social-	Peaceful %&07%Tank Level-Top, mid-dweller %&07%Minimum Tank Size-20 gallons %&07%Diet-Omnivore %&07%Breeding-Egg layer %&07%Care-Easy %&07%pH-6.0 to 9.0 %&07%Hardness-6 to 12 dGH %&07%Temperature-55 to 80F (10 to 27 C)%&07%Origin and Distribution%&07%Descending from the original genetic line of Comet goldfish, the bubble eye goldfish has been manipulated over countless generations to have this eye deformity as well as a double tail fin. Selective breeding has produced this fancy goldfish variety and others, such as Ranchus, Orandas, and fantails. These fish are never found in the wild unless they have been released by aquarists.%&07%Colors and Markings%&07%Like all other goldfish, the bubble eye goldfish can be orange to yellow to white. If they have been bred with a Shubunkin goldfish, they may have a calico pattern. They will often have hunched bodies and a downturned tail peduncle.%&07%As their name denotes, these fish have a large sphere of fluid under each of their eyes. Contained within a delicate flap of skin, these protrusions may hinder your fish's ability to swim and forage. You will see these bulges wrinkle and bend with the movement of your fish, which is normal for this variety of goldfish.%&07%Tankmates%&07%When it comes to tankmates for the bubble eye goldfish, you should take careful consideration of other fishes' swimming and eating ability. The bubble eye goldfish is a very slow, awkward swimmer and requires patience for eating. When you have two giant pillows under your eyes, eating can be a difficult process. If possible, the bubble eye goldfish should only be kept with other bubble eyes or telescope goldfish varieties, such as black moors. These fish with visual deficits will all have equal opportunities for eating without much competition.%&07%Even invertebrates, such as shrimp, may pick at your Bubble Eye Goldfish's sensitive eye tissue, not making them a suitable tankmate. Snails are perfectly safe from predation from these fish but will often quickly overwhelm a tank with their prolific breeding.%&07%Bubble Eye Goldfish Habitat and Care%&07%When it comes to habitat and care of the bubble eye goldfish, this variety requires more care and consideration. Given their large orbital structures, their habitat should be relatively free of décor, especially any abrasive leaves or other sharp decorative items. Your bubble eye should be able to easily navigate all areas of his or her tank and not have any caves or crevices they might get stuck in.%&07%Given the likelihood that your fish will at some point cause a self-inflicted injury, maintaining good water quality is paramount. Good water quality is key to providing your fish with a healthy response to any disease or injury. Be sure to test your water chemistry regularly and stick to a regular maintenance routine.%&07%Although foraging in the substrate of a tank is a normal goldfish behavior, it can easily damage your bubble eye goldfish's delicate eye tissues. None or minimal substrate is recommended to avoid injuries.%&07%Another consideration when setting up an aquarium for your bubble eye is water flow. With their short, often hunched bodies and eye impediments, these fish can be easily pushed around by the outflow from your aquarium filtration. You may need to limit your filtration, which means your tank should have lots of extra volume or baffle your outflow with a sponge or other device that spreads out filter return over a larger surface. Pay attention to how your bubble eye goldfish swim around their tank and take note of any areas they cannot linger in for long without getting pushed away.%&07%If you notice a tear in one of your bubble eye goldfish's delicate eye skin folds, do not attempt to repair it on your own. If the tear is less than 1 cm long, there is a good chance it will heal on its own, provided you maintain good water quality and your fish is eating a well-balanced diet. If the tear is longer, you may want to consult with your aquatic veterinarian. It is very difficult to suture these tears closed, due to the delicate eye tissue, and using glue can cause a very painful inflammatory reaction in fish. Your aquatic veterinarian will best guide you in ensuring your fish does not suffer any secondary infection from a potential non-healing wound.%&07%Bubble Eye Goldfish Diet and Feeding%&07%When it comes to feeding your bubble eye, you must be patient. Given that this variety of goldfish has both visual and swimming difficulties, it takes them considerably more time to eat than most other fish. This is why we recommend they are only kept with other slower, fancy goldfish or only with other bubble eyes.%&07%When choosing a food, you may want to go with a slightly higher protein (33-38 percent) than a regular, maintenance goldfish diet. Fancy varieties have to expend more energy to swim normally, so some extra calories can help them be more active.%&07%Although not commonly recommended for fancy goldfish, the bubble eye goldfish should be fed a floating diet. Normal goldfish foraging behavior, rooting around in the substrate, can cause eye issues. Feed your fish slowly and allow them to eat one pellet at a time. If they are unable to find their food, it will cause additional waste for you and your filter to clean up.%&07%Gender Differences%&07%Like most goldfish, the bubble eye males may display breeding tubercules on their operculum, or gill cover, and on the front edges of their pectoral fins. However, sometimes fancy goldfish do not show these external characteristics. If your fish is struggling to swim and eat, they may not be interested in developing robust reproductive structures, which is normal for most goldfish varieties.%&07%Breeding the Bubble Eye Goldfish%&07%If you are interested in breeding your bubble eye goldfish, please carefully consider the welfare of these fish. You may consider using a veterinarian to perform a full exam, including an ultrasound to confirm sex, to ensure the fish you want to breed are in good health.%&07%Like breeding other goldfish, the bubble eye likes to have plant roots on which to lay their eggs. Be sure to choose soft plants, preferably live, such as Anacharis, to ensure your fish are not injured in their spawning glee. After laying their eggs and fertilizing them, move the mom and dad to another tank so they do not eat their eggs or offspring. After a few days, fry will hatch and require a high protein and fat diet for normal development. There are commercial fried foods available, or you can grow infusoria to feed the fry.%&07%Breeding goldfish can result in a variety of traits. Do not assume that two bubble eye goldfish will only produce bubble eye offspring. You will often get other traits from the fishes' lineages.%&07%%&07%","fish, goldfish, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/gold%20fish%20bubble%20eye.png?alt=media&token=2c2788cb-30a4-4adc-b3fd-325861a82494
Comet Goldfish Species,The Spruce Pets,"The most popular aquarium fish worldwide is the Comet goldfish. These fish are best for beginners since they are hardly enough to tolerate many newbie mistakes. These long-body fish can vary in color from white to bright orange to dark brown. Properly kept, they can grow up to 12 inches or longer, so a large tank is required.%&07%Species Overview%&07%COMMON NAME(S): Comet goldfish, Common goldfish, Sarasa comet%&07%SCIENTIFIC NAME: Carassius auratus%&07%ADULT SIZE: 12 to 14 inches%&07%LIFE EXPECTANCY: 15 to 20 years%&07%Characteristics%&07%Family-Cyprinidae%&07%Origin-Asia %&07%Social-Peaceful%&07%Tank Level-Top, mid-dweller %&07%Minimum Tank Size-50 gallons%&07%Diet-Omnivore%&07%Breeding-Egg layer%&07%Care-Beginner%&07%pH-6.5 to 8.5%&07%Hardness-5-12 dgH %&07%Temperature-33 to 80 F (1 to 27 C)%&07%Origins and Distribution%&07%Comet goldfish originated from the Crucian carp many centuries ago. Like the history of the koi fish (Cyprinus carpio), comet goldfish were originally kept as a food source. Over many generations, people started to notice different mutations in color and would keep those fish separate. Countless generations later, we have the comet goldfish we know today. Further cross-breeding has resulted in many varieties of fancy goldfish, such as the Oranda and Ranchu, with distinctive structural features.%&07%Goldfish have become an invasive species in areas where unwanted pets are ""set free."" Never release your pet fish into the wild. They may suffer a horrible fate or overwhelm the native populations. The goldfish ancestor, the Crucian carp, is native throughout Europe and Asia.%&07%Colors and Markings%&07%The ""traditional"" comet goldfish color is bright orange, where its ancestor is mainly brown with a lighter tan or gold belly. With mass spawning of any color goldfish, you are likely to see a wide variety of color variations passed onto the offspring.%&07%Typical colors of goldfish vary from white, tan, gold, orange, and brown. The body may be one solid color, or your fish may have patches of various colors. Comet goldfish colors can vary widely and may change as the fish ages, and with varying water quality or diet.%&07%Sarasa comets tend to have slightly elongated fins and more saturated colors. They look very similar to koi, often with deep red colors on a white body.%&07%Tankmates%&07%Since goldfish are peaceful community fish, the biggest differential for potential tankmates is fish size and temperature tolerances. Goldfish are freshwater fish, and can tolerate tropical temperatures, but it makes them very hungry, and they will make a mess of your tank.%&07%It is best to choose tankmates that can tolerate slightly less than tropical temperatures, around ambient room temperature, and are large enough to not be accidentally eaten during feeding time.%&07%Good tankmates for goldfish include other goldfish, a school of zebrafish, ornamental minnows or snails.%&07%Due to their wide temperature tolerances, goldfish are also suited to outdoor pond living. Since they do not grow as large as koi, they make a sensible addition to smaller ponds. They can be kept with koi in larger ponds if you choose.%&07%Comet Goldfish Habitat and Care%&07%Comet goldfish make excellent beginner pets because they can tolerate less than ideal water quality. However, this isn't an excuse to skip your usual maintenance!%&07%The biggest consideration with keeping comet goldfish is to provide them with enough room to grow and thrive. A small 10 or 20-gallon tank may be okay for the first few months but starting with a 50-gallon tank or larger will ensure a successful future. A fishbowl is not an appropriate home for any fish.%&07%Comet goldfish like to forage around in the substrate, so gravel or sand is a good substrate to use. You may see them pick up a pebble and carry it around for a bit, but it shouldn't get stuck. In the very unlikely event that something does get stuck, do not panic. Your fish can still breathe around the obstruction while you call for assistance.%&07%This foraging behavior also means that comet goldfish are frequent tank redecorators and will often uproot plants and decorative items. They are also known for eating live plants, and not because they are hungry.%&07%Comet Goldfish Diet and Feeding%&07%Comet goldfish do best when fed a goldfish-appropriate pelleted diet. You should look for a protein around 30 to 32% and pellets will retain their nutrition better than flakes and not make a mess of your tank. There are many goldfish pellets available in pet stores.%&07%Depending on their tank temperature, you may feed your comet goldfish once or twice a day. If your tank is less than 70F (21C), you may feed once a day, but 70F or above, feed twice a day. Your goldfish will always act hungry, so you can supplement their diet with low calorie, low protein treats such as shelled green peas.%&07%Gender Differences%&07%Comet goldfish being kept in a suitable, roomy environment with good water quality and good nutrition can develop external sex characteristics.%&07%Sex differentiation is more common in comet goldfish kept outside and exposed to normal seasonal changes.%&07%Male comet goldfish will develop small papules on their operculum and the leading edge of their pectoral fins. Owners often mistake these for tumors, which is not the case. They may be pronounced depending on the season.%&07%Like many other fish species, females tend to be rounded and larger than the males, regardless of any other external differences.%&07%Breeding the Comet Goldfish%&07%Comet goldfish are very messy spawners, broadcasting eggs and sperm throughout their tank or pond. Breeding usually occurs in the spring for outdoor systems. If your fish are kept inside, you will need to match the changes in day and night light cycles and slowly increase the water temperature.%&07%It is very common for comet goldfish to eat the spawned eggs, so if you want to keep their progeny, move the fertilized eggs to a separate system as soon as possible.%&07%","fish, goldfish, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/goldfish%20comet.png?alt=media&token=6c8949ea-b818-4b0d-b155-d8bb4f663434
Fantail Goldfish Species ,The Spruce Pets,"The fantail goldfish is a common variety of fancy goldfish, known for its double tail. Rather than having one standard tail with a top and bottom caudal fin, these goldfish have been bred to have two top and bottom caudal fins, with the top fin being fused along the top. Take special consideration when keeping fantail goldfish to accommodate their impaired swimming ability.%&07%Species Overview%&07%COMMON NAMES: Fantail goldfish, double tail goldfish%&07%SCIENTIFIC NAME: Carassius auratus%&07%ADULT SIZE: 7 inches%&07%LIFE EXPECTANCY: 10 to 15 years%&07%Characteristics%&07%Family-Cyprinidae %&07%Origin-Asia %&07%Social-Peaceful %&07%Tank Level-Top, mid-dweller %&07%Minimum Tank Size-20 gallons %&07%Diet-Omnivore %&07%Breeding-Egg layer %&07%Care-Easy %&07%pH-6.0 to 9.0 %&07%Hardness-6 to 12 dGH %&07%Temperature-55 to 80F (10 to 27 C) %&07%	%&07%Origin and Distribution%&07%Although the original comet goldfish originated from the Crucian Carp in Asia, the fantail goldfish is not found in the wild and has been created through selective breeding by humans. Classified as a variety of ""fancy"" goldfish, the fantail goldfish was created through breeding fish with desired characteristics together over countless generations.%&07%Colors and Markings%&07%Fantail goldfish are known for their double tails, but also tend to have short bodies and may have elongated pectoral and anal fins. Depending on if your fantail has been bred with other varieties of fancy goldfish, such as Orandas, Ryukins, or Nearlscales, your fantail may take on some characteristics of those other goldfish, such as a small wen (head swelling), tall body, or enlarged coelom. Fantail goldfish are typically orange to white in color but can be red or multicolored if they have been crossed with a shubunkin or Ryukin goldfish variety.%&07%Tankmates%&07%As for other goldfish, these options are the best for selecting tankmates for fantail goldfish.%&07%None%&07%Some goldfish just do not get along with others, and that is just fine. Goldfish can be kept individually, but still need a large, filtered aquarium for maintaining their best health. Be sure to spend lots of time with a goldfish housed alone and spoil it like the special only child it is.%&07%Another Goldfish%&07%The best tankmate for a fantail goldfish is another fancy goldfish. It is best to not add another goldfish with a long-body, such as a comet or shubunkin, since they may out-swim your fancy goldfish and get to all the food faster. It is best to choose another fancy goldfish of similar slow swimming ability to ensure everyone has a fair share of the food and space.%&07%Zebrafish%&07%When adding fish to a goldfish tank, the most important aspect to consider is the temperate nature of the aquatic environment. Goldfish are kept at lower temperatures than most tropical fish species, making them incompatible. However, a school of zebrafish (zebra danio) is a great addition to a goldfish tank. They like to be in a group, so be sure to have at least five zebrafish. There are many fin varieties and colors of zebrafish to choose from.%&07%Fantail Goldfish Habitat and Care%&07%Like other goldfish varieties, the fantail goldfish is an easy-going, low maintenance fish. However, as with all other goldfish, they are messier than most other pet fish and will require you to stick to your regular maintenance routine. Given their tail shape, fantail goldfish are not the most efficient swimmers, so do not crowd their environment with lots of décor items. You may see them resting more frequently than other goldfish, so having an open area on the substrate will help them rest more comfortably.%&07%Fantail Goldfish Diet and Feeding%&07%There are many pelleted diets available to feed your fantail goldfish. When choosing a pellet, be sure to choose the correct pellet size for your fish to easily swallow. Since they do not have an acidic stomach, goldfish rely on their grinding molars to crush their food to digest it properly. Most goldfish will require about 32-35% protein, but given their swimming difficulties, fancy goldfish should be on a slightly higher protein level in the diet. Choose a diet with a fat content around 4-5% and replace your food container every 6 months to ensure adequate vitamin C levels. Sinking diets are recommended to help with any fish prone to buoyancy disorders, so they don't gulp air at the surface while eating a floating food.%&07%Feeding frequency will depend on your tank's temperature. Below 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius), you should be feeding your goldfish once a day. At 70 degrees Fahrenheit and above, you should be feeding your goldfish twice a day. Sprinkle just enough food for them to eat leisurely for 5 minutes. If you see any uneaten food after feeding time, you are feeding too much. Remove uneaten food from an aquarium to prevent waste accumulation.%&07%Gender Differences%&07%Like comet goldfish, fantail goldfish have distinguishable features for males. Breeding tubercles, raised white bumps, will appear on the operculum (gill cover) and leading edge of the pectoral fin in males during spawning season. Females tend to be rounder, but with the enlarged belly on Fantails, this is not reliable.%&07%Breeding the Fantail Goldfish%&07%Goldfish are avid breeders, and even novice fish parents can usually get their goldfish to breed. Be sure to increase your goldfish's protein and fat in the diet prior to breeding to ensure full gonad development. Fantail goldfish should be placed in a breeding tank with one male and one female. Usually, raising the water temperature and introducing live plants will encourage your fish to start breeding. Increasing the springtime daylight length will also encourage spawning, and this can be manipulated with indoor lighting. Once the parents have spawned, remove them from the breeding tank or they will eat the eggs. Feed the babies powdered fried food when they become free-swimming after hatching.%&07%","fish, goldfish, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/goldfish%20fantail.png?alt=media&token=492cca6b-0010-4c8b-a9f4-118c902a939a
Shubunkin Goldfish Species,The Spruce Pets,"The Shubunkin goldfish is a variety of long-bodied goldfish. They are very similar to the standard Comet goldfish except for their distinctive calico coloration and elongated fins.

They originated in Japan through several generations of cross breeding the standard (short fin) and Comet (long fin) goldfish with calico telescope goldfish. They are not found in the wild since they were cultivated through human manipulation. Their ancestor, the Crucian carp, is found throughout Europe and Asia.%&07%Colors and Markings%&07%The Shubunkin is distinctive from the Comet goldfish in their coloration and more elongated fins. With Comet goldfish varying between white, brown, gold, yellow and red, the Shubunkin is distinguished by its ""calico"" markings. These fish have a pale white to iridescent body with overlying black or blue markings, splashed with reds and yellows. The Shubunkin has a very recognizable appearance when mixed with other goldfish species. Some other varieties of goldfish can be crossed with Shubunkins to have fancy goldfish body types with Shubunkin coloration.%&07%Some Shubunkins may have very clear scales or patches of skin that are scaleless, like their doitsu koi cousins. All of their fins are slightly longer than Comet goldfish. The fins will often contain streaks of black to match their body markings.%&07%Tankmates%&07%The Shubunkin can have tankmates similar to the Comet goldfish. Being temperate fish, they should not be mixed with any tropical species of fish. Shubunkins are very social fish and not aggressive to other fish. They are voracious eaters, so anything small enough to fit in their mouth can be mistakenly eaten, including small fish and invertebrates. %&07%Shubunkin Habitat and Care%&07%Like all other goldfish, your Shubunkins will require a tank with a filter, not a bowl. They do not require heated water and do well at room temperature. Shubunkins will make a lot of waste, and you will need to keep a close eye on your tank's nitrogen cycle levels to ensure your nitrate stays below 20 mg/L. Be sure your aquarium has strong filtration.%&07%Shubunkins are not very picky about their décor. As long as their tank is large enough, they will be active fish and swim constantly. Try not to add too many obstacles, since this may tear longer fins.%&07%Goldfish are active foragers and will often be seen picking up their substrate and spitting it back out. This is a normal behavior for goldfish and you should not be too concerned about something getting stuck in their mouths. The biggest concern for an oral foreign body are the gel balls containing beneficial bacteria. These can easily get stuck and cause your fish to stop eating. If your fish has an oral foreign body, call your aquatic veterinarian immediately.%&07%Shubunkin Diet and Feeding%&07%Shubunkins are omnivores and can eat commercially available goldfish foods. Stick to a pelleted diet around 32-35% protein and 5-7% fat. Goldfish are not vegetarians and need some animal protein sources for correct development. Reproductively-active and juvenile fish will need increased protein and fat.%&07%Feed your goldfish for 3-5 minutes once a day if the temperature is at or below 70F (21C). Above 70F, you will need to feed your goldfish twice a day. Being ectotherms with a wide temperature tolerance, the warmer the water temperature, the hungrier your Shubunkins will be. Do not let uneaten food accumulate in the aquarium.%&07%You can feed your Shubunkins occasional treats. Veggies, such as shelled green peas, can be fed up to once a day as a treat. Meaty treats, such as frozen bloodworms or brine shrimp, should be fed no more than once a week.%&07%Gender Differences%&07%Unlike the Comet goldfish, not all male Shubunkins will exhibit the classic breeding tubercles on the pectoral fins and sides of the operculum. Females will have rounder bellies than males, but only if reproductively active. It is very hard to distinguish males from females in fish that are not preparing to spawning.%&07%Breeding the Shubunkin%&07%With the correct cues in temperature and light and a supportive diet, even beginners can easily breed their Shubunkins. The males will often be seen chasing the females around the tank in order to get them to release their eggs. Following behind, the males will externally fertilize the eggs which will settle throughout your tank. Often, goldfish will concentrate their breeding efforts on plant material with exposed roots to catch the eggs.%&07%After your fish have spawned, it is critical to remove the adult fish from the aquarium so they do not eat their eggs. This can be easily accomplished by setting up a special spawning tank and then removing the adults to their main tank afterwards. One spawning can produce up to 1000 eggs. Fry will emerge from their eggs in about 6 days and start swimming and eating. Be sure to feed them an appropriate diet for good development.%&07%","fish, goldfish, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/goldfish%20shubunkin.png?alt=media&token=a3ba144a-7029-442c-ae74-eed1eb6c48ec
Goldfish Behavior,The Spruce Pets,"If you keep pet goldfish, you have almost certainly spent many hours watching them go about their daily lives, interacting with their surroundings and each other, and doing all of the normal things that goldfish do!%&07%Socialization and taming%&07%Goldfish are fairly social fish, and are also credited with the ability to learn by association. Unless they are in competition with each other for food, even goldfish of different sizes and ages will rarely behave aggressively towards each other, and will come to recognize the other fish in their tank over time.%&07%Goldfish also become used to the presence of the people that feed them and that they see every day. They will soon learn when feeding time is and that, if someone approaches, they might soon be fed! Goldfish will often come to the top of the tank when someone approaches or follow the progress of a hand moving on the other side of the glass.%&07%Foraging%&07%Goldfish love to dig about in the substrate of the tank! This is normal goldfish behavior and one that you will be able to observe quite often. There are elements of both foraging for food scraps and making their mark on their environment involved with this activity, and as grazing fish, goldfish do like to constantly have something to nibble on!%&07%Goldfish will also often eat the plants within their tank, and this behavior can be viewed in the same way as any other grazing animal, such as a horse or a cow, whose metabolism is constantly in motion.%&07%Chasing%&07%Goldfish are not always among the fastest moving fish, but occasionally they will show quite a turn of speed! If your goldfish are chasing each other around the tank, this is sometimes the lead up to mating and generally not cause for concern. However, if your tank is overcrowded or your fish are in competition over food, your goldfish may become stressed and chase each other off in competition for resources.%&07%Hovering at the tank’s surface%&07%Goldfish tend to use the full depth of their tanks from top to bottom, unlike some species that generally show a marked preference for a certain area of the tank. However, goldfish will congregate near to the top of the tank if they are expecting food or if the oxygen levels in the tank are low. If your fish are gulping air at the surface of the tank or are regularly breaking the surface of the water, check your water quality and aeration for any problems.%&07%","fish, goldfish, diseases",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20fish.png?alt=media&token=3e7020a9-4066-47b6-9be3-66d171b840be
Common Goldfish Diseases,The Spruce Pets,"Goldfish are susceptible to many freshwater diseases. If you are a goldfish owner, there are some diseases and conditions you should pay particular attention to:%&07%Poor Water Quality%&07%Although not technically a disease, poor water quality is the most common cause of disease in goldfish. Goldfish are messy critters and create a lot of waste and foul water quickly. Inappropriate environments, such as antiquated bowls or severely overcrowded systems, can contribute to chronic stress through poor water quality. A fish unable to escape a toxic system will become chronically stressed, with decrease in growth, immune function, and reproductive capability.%&07%It is critical to make sure your goldfish have enough space for a healthy life. For comets and other long-bodied goldfish, they will require 20 gallons per fish to start. You will likely need close to 50 to 75 gallons per fish as they mature. Goldfish can grow up to 14 to 16 inches, so plan on that size, not 2 to 3"" inches No fish deserves to live in a filthy bowl. All fish require filtered tanks, but goldfish do not require heaters.%&07%Test your water quality regularly and be sure to correct any abnormalities. Feeding high protein flake food can be a big problem in many goldfish tanks. Always try to feed a pelleted diet in an appropriate size for your fish. If you are having trouble keeping your water quality within range, contact your aquatic veterinarian for additional support.%&07%Parasites%&07%Bringing a fish home from the pet store is the highest risk point in a fish's life for coming into contact with a parasite. In pet stores, fish from many sources and exposures are mixed in different systems and most parasites can travel in water and on equipment.%&07%%&07%Clinical signs of parasites in goldfish include missing scales, flashing, bruising, lethargy, and/or sudden death. The most common goldfish diseases include:%&07%•	Ichthyophthirius multifiilis (White spot disease)%&07%•	Trichodina%&07%•	Mongenean trematodes (""Flukes"")%&07%•	Icthyobodo (""Costia"")%&07%•	Learnea spp. (Anchor worms)%&07%•	Argulus spp. (Fish lice)%&07%•	Chilodonella%&07%The best prevention of parasites is a strict quarantine protocol. There is no ""one size fits all"" treatment for parasites, so a definitive diagnosis from an aquatic veterinarian is critical to ensure proper treatment. Just guessing and throwing a bunch of OTC medications at your fish is a recipe for death.%&07%Neurofibromas%&07%These ""lumps"" are common in comet goldfish, particularly those kept outdoors. Neurofibromas form from neural tissue deep within skin layers and are nearly impossible to treat.1 They can commonly form a ""stalk"" and fall off, only to grow back again. Some fish may have one or two localized lumps or disseminated throughout the fish's body.%&07%Treatment is not warranted due to recurrence. Multiple modalities utilizing surgery and cryotherapy have not been successful. It is not worth putting your fish through difficult treatment that will not resolve the issue. Since these benign tumors arise from neural tissue, there is no treatment currently available that can target these types of tissues specifically.%&07%Buoyancy Disorders%&07%Goldfish may be prone to both negative and positive buoyancy disorders. Being physostomous fish, they have a pneumatic duct between their esophagus and swim bladder, allowing them to swallow air to inflate their swim bladder.2 A separate gland, called the oval, is responsible for removing excess air.%&07%Positive buoyancy disorders occur most commonly after feeding. Goldfish, the golden retrievers of the fish world, who feed vigorously at the surface, will commonly suck in too much air. It will either end up in the GI tract or the swim bladder. After the excess air is removed, the fish goes back to normal. Malfunction of the oval has been known to occur, resulting in permanent positive buoyancy disorders. Surgery is often required to correct these issues.%&07%Negative buoyancy disorders are most common secondary to stress or poor diet. Simply put, your fish doesn't have the inclination or energy to swim. Once you alleviate the stress and give your fish a proper diet, they will revert to normal behavior. External ""wheelchair"" floats are extremely dangerous and can seriously hurt your fish.%&07%Polycystic Kidney Disease%&07% %&07%Goldfish are prone to a disease that forms cysts in their kidneys, which cause malfunction and serious tissue damage. Unfortunately, the cause of this disease is unknown and there is no treatment. Once the kidneys have been damaged, as in many other species, they do not recover.%&07%Clinical signs of polycystic kidney disease mostly look like your fish swallowed a baseball, softball or even volleyball. Fish can act normal despite an abnormal external appearance. Ultrasound is required for diagnosis. Do not attempt to squeeze your fish! This can cause serious organ damage and will not help your fish in any way.%&07%Cloudy Eyes and Popeye%&07%Cloudy fisheyes are common secondary to poor water quality, trauma, and secondary disease. Some fish may have eyes that poke out more than their counterparts, especially some fancy varieties, making them more prone to trauma.%&07%Popeye is a common internet disease for which there is no one treatment. Eyes can become distended from many secondary issues and you should consult with an aquatic veterinarian to get to the root cause quickly and develop an effective treatment plan before the eyes are lost.%&07%Red Streaks on Skin and Fins%&07%Red streaks on skin and fins are common symptoms of stress and poor water quality. If you see these on your fish, it is important to check your water quality as soon as possible. If it is off, correcting it can resolve these streaky issues.%&07%If your water quality is within range and no major changes have been recently made, it is critical to identify the stressor and remove it from your system.%&07%Non Diseases%&07%There are a few diseases out there on the internet that are technically not diseases. They are symptoms of many common fish diseases.%&07%This describes the clinical condition when fluid collects between the scales of a fish, and they look like a pinecone. It is a clinical sign of kidney or gill malfunction and is not a disease.%&07%""Swim Bladder""%&07%Yes, your fish has a swim bladder. ""Swim bladder"" disease can be many different things and requires a consultation from an aquatic veterinarian. There is no one cause of buoyancy disorders.%&07%%&07%","fish, goldfish, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20fish.png?alt=media&token=3e7020a9-4066-47b6-9be3-66d171b840be
Koi Fish Care,The Spruce Pets,"If you know someone who has a pond, chances are they keep a couple of Koi to brighten it up.%&07%Koi fish are some of the most common, well-known fish to keep in outdoor garden ponds.%&07%In Japan where they were first bred, they are highly prized and are even the main subjects of many myths and artwork.%&07%Although they are directly related to goldfish, it would be a big mistake to assume that they have the same level of care. These fish could never live in a tank, they need an outdoor pond.%&07%Advertisements%&07%Do you think you are ready to open your pond to a few Koi? Read on to discover the best possible way to care for these gorgeous, long-living carp.%&07%Koi fish are ornamental variations of the common carp (Cyprinus carpio). They belong to the family Cyprinidae, which includes all carps and minnows.%&07%The word Koi comes from the Japanese word for carp.%&07%Keeping and breeding Koi began in 19th century Japan when farmers kept colorful specimens of the native carp in their rice gardens.%&07%Now the keeping and breeding of these fish is a widespread and lucrative industry.%&07%Unfortunately, the popularity of these beautiful fish has led them to become invasive in waters all over the world.%&07%In the wild, common carp only live for about 20 years due. But captive Koi can live up to 50 years if they are cared for properly.%&07%Common varieties found in most backyard ponds can be purchased from pond and aquarium suppliers for anywhere between $50 and $80.%&07%Special varieties must be purchased from a breeder – these can be very expensive, ranging from as low as $200 to as high as $1000+.%&07%Types%&07%Koi fish can reach lengths of up to 3 feet – they are one of the largest cyprinids and one of the largest fish commonly kept in backyard ponds.%&07%They generally have two barbels on both sides of the jaw and have a round snout and a toothless jaw for taking in gulps of prey.%&07%Advertisements%&07%Females are larger and have rounder bodies than males. Typically, their fins are short and rounded, with lobed caudal fins. However, certain varieties are bred for their long trailing fins.%&07%These gorgeous fish come in striking colors. They are typically white or silver, with iridescent scales and colorful spots and markings.%&07%These markings can be red, gold, orange, black, or even deep blue.%&07%Their exact color and markings depending on the type.%&07%Butterfly Koi Fish%&07%Butterfly Koi (also known as Dragon Koi) are named after their long pectoral and caudal fins. They are highly prized and valuable to keepers.%&07%This variety can be found in any of the typical color forms and is only set apart from others by the length of its fins.%&07%Japanese Koi Fish%&07%These are the most common Koi that you will see in most ponds and water gardens.%&07%Kohaku Japanese Koi are white with orange/red markings. They are considered the standard variety.%&07%Tancho Koi are Kohaku Koi with a single red spot on the top of the head.%&07%Dragon Koi Fish%&07%The dragon can refer to two different kinds of Koi. More often, it’s just another term for the Butterfly Koi.%&07%The Kumonryu variant is also referred to as a Dragon Fish. This is a black and white fish with markings that change depending on the seasons.%&07%Black and White Koi Fish%&07%Shiro Utsui fish are white with black spots and markings. Some have a split-head pattern with white on one side of the head and black on the other.%&07%Matsuba Koi can be black and white as well, but can also have black markings over a red or gold body.%&07%Gold Koi Fish%&07%Ogon is a highly prized one-color variety. An Ogon fish is entirely silver, orange or gold.%&07%Typical Koi with gold markings over white bodies are called Ki. Kinrin fish have beautiful scales that sparkle like gold coins.%&07%%&07%Care%&07%Koi is susceptible to a fatal herpesvirus. Koi herpesvirus, or KHV, is a contagious virus that affects all varieties of the common carp.%&07%Once a fish has been infected, there is an 80 percent chance that it will die from the illness.%&07%Death occurs as quickly as a day or two and any fish that survive the infection become permanent carriers that can infect other carp in the pond.%&07%Symptoms of KHV include breathing difficulty, sunken eyes, and red and white lesions at the gills. In many cases, the whole population must be euthanized once one fish is infected.%&07%Advertisements%&07%KHV can be prevented by carefully inspecting the health of any new carp that you introduce to your pond. New fish should be quarantined for up to 2 weeks before you place them in your pond.%&07%Other illnesses and parasites that affect Koi fish include fish lice, ich, and ulcerative diseases that affect goldfish and other carp.%&07%Watch for erratic or uncoordinated swimming, lethargy, or breathing difficulty. Your fish will gulp at the air if it is having trouble breathing.%&07%Even though these fish have a very high tolerance for poor water quality pond maintenance is the most important aspect of care and disease prevention.%&07%You should clean the pond and check your filter every 2 to 4 weeks.%&07%Diet%&07%In the wild, these fish are known for their huge appetites and have a similar diet to goldfish.%&07%They are omnivores that eat seeds and plant material, algae, zooplankton, and insects. They do not prey on other fish but may eat their eggs.%&07%In a well-stocked pond, your fish will find vegetation and critters to munch on. The best diet for them includes an even mix of both natural and commercial foods.%&07%They will readily eat algae and aquatic plants. You should keep a good stock of algae and floating weeds to discourage them from uprooting the plants in your water garden.%&07%Advertisements%&07%To satisfy their love of zooplankton, introduce water fleas and brine shrimp to your pond. You can also give them insects and insect larvae purchased from an aquarium supplier or bait shop.%&07%Any commercial foods you give them should be high in protein. They will feed at all levels of the pond and can be given pellets that will reach all depths. You can supplement their diets with farm grains such as rice and corn.%&07%Most of your Koi’s nutrition will come from what they find in your pond. You can give them up to 3 small portions of additional pellet food per day.%&07%An automatic fish feeder set for twice a day works wonders for most pond fish.%&07%Breeding%&07%Breeding Koi fish will require a separate pond for mating and spawning.%&07%Advertisements%&07%It can be done naturally or induced through artificial means such as hormone injections. The fish will reach sexual maturity between 2 and 5 years old and natural breeding will occur in the springtime.%&07%In a breeding pond, there should be 2-3 males for every female. Larger, older females are the best spawners.%&07%To encourage natural breeding conditions, keep your breeding pond at temperatures between 64-72°F.%&07%They should be fed food high in protein and include both natural and commercial foods, up to 3 times a day.%&07%Females will lay their eggs in your shallow-water vegetation, and the male will fertilize them once they are laid. This kind of external fertilization occurs in many different species of fish.%&07%Once the eggs are fertilized, they must be removed and placed in an incubation tank. They will hatch in 3 to 4 days.%&07%Your newborn fish will not look like much. In the larval stage, they are extremely tiny and will drift through the water like zooplankton.%&07%Once they reach the fry stage and lose their yolk sacs, they will look like very tiny scale-less fish.%&07%Fry can be reared in an indoor tank until they reach the juvenile stage. They should be fed larval brine shrimp and hardboiled eggs mixed with water.%&07%Once they reach the juvenile stage, they will look just like miniature versions of adult fish. They can then be placed in the pond and given the same foods that you give the adults.%&07%","fish, koi, general, nutrient",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20fish.png?alt=media&token=3e7020a9-4066-47b6-9be3-66d171b840be
Pond for Koi Fish,The Spruce Pets,"Habitat and Pond Conditions%&07%The Koi’s wild counterpart, the common carp, is native to Europe and Asia.%&07%They live in lakes, ponds, and streams with muddy bottoms and minimal flow.

Common Koi Fish Diseases,The Spruce Pets,"Are you afraid that your koi fish (current or future ones) will get sick? Do you want to know what to look out for so you can ensure they survive?%&07%In this post, you’ll discover common koi fish diseases, what can cause them, how to spot them, and more. By the end, you should feel like you can take great care of your fish and know how to help them best.%&07%You can find out more about pond fish by checking out our pond fish guide.%&07%What Can Cause Koi Fish Diseases%&07%Poor Water Quality %&07%A number of things can lead to unhealthy or unsafe water conditions for your koi fish. Too much ammonia or nitrite in the water, if the pH levels are too high or too low, and more can stress your koi and make them sick.%&07%This is why regular pond maintenance and pond cleaning is critical for your koi pond.%&07%Environmental Stress %&07%Changes in temperature or light exposure, cramped swimming room, not having the right number of fish, and more can stress your koi, weakening their immune system and making them more susceptible to disease.%&07%Parasites And Fungal Infections %&07%Parasites such as flukes or worms will feed on the blood and tissue of your koi, which can weaken their immune system. Fungal infections may result in sores or lesions on their skin, which must be treated with the appropriate medication.%&07%Common Koi Diseases%&07%1. Anchor Worm%&07%Anchor worm is one of the most common koi diseases. It’s caused by a parasitic crustacean called lernaea cyprinacea. The parasite attaches itself to the koi’s skin, causing irritation and discomfort. The worms may be visible on the side or back of the fish; they have an anchor-like shape with a flat head attached to a long body. Look for small white spots on your fish’s skin. Dip a cotton swab into rubbing alcohol and gently dab the affected area and see if worms emerge from the skin. %&07%2. White Spot Disease%&07%White spot disease is caused by a microscopic parasite known as Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (Ich). This parasite causes white spots to form on their bodies. These spots can vary in size but are typically very small—about 0.1 millimeters in diameter—and will often appear in clusters on your koi’s fins or body.%&07%3. Fin Rot%&07%Fin rot is one of the more serious koi diseases, as it can cause irreparable damage to your fish’s fins and scales. Fin rot is caused by bacteria that attack weakened areas in your koi’s fins or skin, causing them to become discolored and frayed around the edges. If left untreated, fin rot can spread rapidly throughout your pond. %&07%4. Mouth Rot%&07%Mouth rot is another common koi disease that is caused by bacteria infecting their mouths and gills. It usually presents itself as redness or swelling around your fish’s mouth and increased mucus production or bleeding from wounds or lesions in the mouth area. It can also lead to secondary infections in other parts of their bodies, including eyes and scales.%&07%5. Ich%&07%Ich (Ichthyophthirius Multifiliis) is one of the most common diseases among koi fish. It’s caused by a parasite that attacks both skin and gills, causing white spots across the body of the fish. It’s important to note that Ich is highly contagious, so if you spot it in one fish, it’s likely already spread.%&07%6. Dropsy%&07%Dropsy is another common disease among koi fish that is often caused by bacterial infections or parasites. Symptoms include bloating around the abdomen area and protruding scales along the sides of the body. Dropsy can be deadly if left untreated. Proper medication and changes in water quality are usually enough to cure Dropsy in its early stages. %&07%7. Aeromonas%&07%Aeromonas is yet another bacterial infection that affects koi ponds and can be deadly if not treated promptly. Symptoms include reddening of fins and tail edges, ulcers forming on the skin, and discoloration around the mouth area. Aeromonas can be treated with antibiotics.%&07%8. Ulcers%&07%Ulcers are also fairly common among koi fish and can be caused by bacteria or parasites entering through open wounds on the skin surface. Symptoms include red streaks radiating from an area on the body, loss of appetite, lethargy, cloudy eyes, difficulty swimming straight up or down in the water column, etc. Treatments vary depending on severity.%&07%9. Columnaris%&07%Columnaris is one of the most common diseases affecting koi, and it is caused by a bacterium called Flavobacterium columnare. Symptoms include grayish patches on the skin or fins, frayed fins, and open sores on the skin or mouth. Left untreated, columnaris can rapidly spread throughout an entire pond. Treatment usually involves antibiotics or other medications to boost immunity and reduce inflammation. %&07%10. Flukes%&07%Flukes (also known as flatworms) are parasites that attach themselves to the gills of koi fish and feed off their blood supply. This leads to difficulty breathing as well as scratching against objects in an effort to get rid of them. Flukes are usually treated with special medications that kill off both adult worms and eggs before they hatch into larvae again. It’s important to note that flukes can also be transmitted from one fish to another, so quarantine any new additions to your pond for at least 30 days before introducing them into your existing population. %&07%11. Fish Lice%&07%Fish lice (sometimes called anchor worms) are small parasites that attach themselves to the skin or fins of koi fish and feed off their blood supply. They cause intense itching, which leads to rubbing against objects in an effort to get rid of them; this results in damaged fins which further increases stress levels in affected fish. These pests are typically treated with special medications that not only kill off adult lice but also prevent eggs from hatching into larvae again. It’s important that all areas where fish have been rubbing against objects (such as rocks or plants) be carefully cleaned prior to treatments beginning in order to prevent reinfection. %&07%12. Carp Pox%&07%Carp pox is a highly contagious virus that affects koi fish and other species of carp. It appears as white spots on their skin which eventually develop into raised lesions over time if left untreated. Treatment typically involves antiviral medications administered either orally or through injections. Once infected, there’s no cure for this disease, so prevention should always be a top priority when dealing with carp pox in koi ponds. %&07%13. Costia %&07%Costia is an illness caused by protozoan parasites that attach themselves to the skin or gills of your koi. The most common symptom of Costia is small, white spots on the body or fins of your fish. You may also notice rapid breathing or listlessness in your koi as they struggle with this parasite.%&07%14. Chilodonella %&07%Chilodonella is a protozoan parasite that attaches itself to the gills of your fish. Signs of Chilodonella include greyish patches on the body, clamped fins, gasping for air at the water’s surface, and reddened eyes due to inflammation caused by this parasite.%&07%15. Trichodina %&07%Trichodina is another protozoan parasite that affects koi fish by attaching itself directly to their skin or gills. Symptoms include scratching against objects in the pond and fast breathing due to irritation from this parasite. You may also notice white patches on the skin or fin edges which is a sign of infection from Trichodina.%&07%16. Pinecone Disease%&07%Pinecone disease is a common koi disease that is caused by a bacteria known as Mycobacterium sp. This bacteria affects the skin and fins of koi, causing them to develop raised bumps that resemble pinecones. Pinecone disease is most commonly seen in koi that are kept in ponds with poor water quality.%&07%17. Swim Bladder Disease%&07%Swim bladder disease is a common koi disease that can be caused by a number of different factors, including bacterial infections, parasites, and physical injuries. This disease affects the swim bladder, which is a sac located in the fish’s abdomen that helps to control its buoyancy. Damage or infection can cause the fish to float abnormally or even sink to the bottom of the pond.%&07%*If left untreated, many of these diseases can lead to secondary bacterial infections and death%&07%Spotting Sick Koi Fish%&07%One of the most obvious signs of sickness in a koi fish is changes in color or marking. If your koi’s colors become dull or faded, this could indicate a possible health issue.%&07%Behavioral changes can also indicate a possible health issue with your koi fish. If you notice that your fish is swimming erratically or listlessly, this could be an indication that something is wrong with them. It is also important to note any changes in appetite as well and if your koi are hiding.%&07%Keep an eye out for physical deformities such as discolored eyes, open sores on the body, protruding scales, and gills that appear swollen or red.%&07%Analyzing Koi Fish For Diseases%&07%Appearance Alterations %&07%This could include white spots on their skin or fins, bloated abdomens, loss of color, sores or ulcers on their body, or even discolored eyes. All of these should be addressed immediately. %&07% Water Quality %&07%Poor water quality can lead to various illnesses in koi fish, such as bacterial infections, parasites, and fungal infections.%&07%Waste Material%&07%If you notice an abnormal amount of waste material in the water or some floating on the pond’s surface, it could mean something is wrong with them. Excess waste in their environment could be caused by an infection compromising their immune system. It could also indicate an imbalance in the diet they are receiving.%&07%Physical Exam %&07%This includes looking at the coloration of their skin, checking for any signs of injury such as sores or lesions, noting any changes in behavior such as lethargy or aggression towards other fish, and observing how they swim, like swimming too fast or too slow compared to usual activity levels. %&07%Death Patterns %&07%When analyzing a koi fish disease, it’s important to look at death patterns within similar species/breeds/ages. Certain diseases tend to affect certain groups more severely than others. By keeping track over time and noticing any trends among deaths within particular groups, you can spot issues earlier before they become widespread problems throughout the entire population. %&07%Treating Koi Carp Diseases And Fixing The Cause%&07%This is not intended to replace professional veterinary care or advice. While these treatments are designed to aid in managing symptoms, results may vary. It’s always best to contact a veterinarian for medical advice.%&07%Fungal Infection%&07%The best way to treat fungal infections is to increase oxygen levels in your pond and use a safe anti-fungal medication like Formalin or Methylene blue. It’s important to note that these medications should only be used after consulting with a veterinarian or aquatic specialist. %&07%Bacterial Infection%&07%Bacterial infections can be treated with antibiotics, but it’s important to consult with an expert before administering them. Incorrect dosing can lead to long-term health problems for your pond fish. %&07%Parasitic Infestation%&07%To treat parasitic infestations in your pond, you should first address any water quality issues by testing pH levels regularly and changing out a portion of the water every week or two, depending on the usage and size of the pond. After fixing any water quality issues, you may want to consider using an anti-parasite medication.%&07%Keep Your Water Quality At Its Best With Premier Pond’s Maintenance Service%&07%If you’re looking for an easy way to ensure your pond’s water quality remains at its best, Premier Pond’s maintenance service is the perfect solution.

General Rabbit Care,The Spruce Pets,"Rabbits are active and playful animals that are also very social. They will form a close bond with other rabbits and even with people. If you know what to expect from pet rabbits, they have the potential to be wonderful pets. The ideal owner for a pet rabbit is an individual or family with the time and space to dedicate to an active pet that enjoys cuddling and playing and requires a moderate amount of maintenance. Rabbits come in many different breeds that range in appearance, including Lionhead, Mini lop, Mini Rex, Rex, Lop, Dutch, English Spot, and Hoot.","rabbit, headline",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rabbit.png?alt=media&token=fb4b3c52-7175-455a-8810-466c21d54413
General Care for a Pet Rabbit,The Spruce Pets,"Rabbits are prey animals, which means housing your rabbit outdoors is generally not a good idea; keep your rabbit enclosure indoors.%&07%When not being directly supervised, your rabbit should be kept in an enclosure that's at least 2 feet by 3 feet for one medium-size rabbit. Multiple rabbits housed together need more space. The height of the enclosure should be greater than the height of your rabbit when it fully stretches up on its hind legs. Because rabbits have tender feet, avoid wire-bottom cages; a better choice is a plastic-bottom dog crate.3%&07%Inside the enclosure, provide your rabbit with:%&07%•	Plenty of toys, including chew toys%&07%•	A shelf onto which your rabbit can hop to maintain leg strength%&07%•	Ceramic food and water dishes%&07%•	A litter box%&07%With all the items in the enclosure, make sure there's still enough room for your rabbit to fully stretch out with its back legs extended.%&07%Many pet rabbits are allowed to roam around the house when their owners are around. If you choose to allow this, be very careful to rabbit-proof your home. Rabbits love to chew, and dangerous electrical cords are at just the right height for them to find and munch on.%&07%If you'd rather not give your rabbit run of the house, you can provide it with an exercise pen. Pens designed for puppies are ideal. They provide room to move without giving your bunny the option of exploring potentially dangerous spaces. Many owners even use exercise pens as their rabbit's primary enclosure.%&07%Specific Substrate Needs%&07%Regardless of what type of enclosure you choose for your rabbit, make sure the floor is nonslip. Some owners put washable carpeting on the enclosure floor to give the rabbit some cushion. You also can put down some straw for your rabbit to make a cozy nest. Use dye-free paper litter in the litter box; never use clumping litter. Plan to clean the litter box at least every other day and wipe down the whole enclosure with mild soap and water weekly.%&07%Grooming%&07%Rabbits do groom themselves, but brushing helps to remove loose fur and prevent hairballs. Brush short-hair rabbits roughly once a week. Long-hair rabbits often need brushing daily to prevent tangles and mats. %&07%Baths are generally not necessary, though you might need to spot clean a dirty part of your rabbit’s coat by gently rubbing it with a damp cloth. %&07%Most rabbits also need nail trims, as they don’t naturally wear down their nails enough in their indoor environment. Your vet can show you how to properly trim nails at home.%&07%Upkeep Costs%&07%Rabbits may be small, but they are relatively expensive animals. On a monthly basis, your primary costs will be for food and litter. Plus, you’ll need to replace worn toys—especially chew toys—on a regular basis. Finally, don’t forget to budget for routine veterinary checkups and emergencies. %&07%Pros & Cons of Keeping a Rabbit as a Pet%&07%Rabbits are quiet pets that don’t take up a great deal of space. They also can be quite social, playful, and engaged with their owners. However, their upkeep is relatively expensive.

Rabbits Nutrient,The Spruce Pets,"Rabbits are herbivores, and their daily diet should consist mostly of hay. Feed an unlimited amount of grass hay each day, such as timothy, oat hay, or orchard grass; avoid alfalfa hay. You can simply pile the hay in the enclosure or put it in a special feeder called a hopper. Just make sure there's always some available.%&07%Supplement the hay with a variety of green leafy vegetables. Good choices include lettuce (except iceberg), herbs, watercress, carrot tops, cucumbers, and sprouts. Provide a more limited supply of other vegetables and fruits. Check with your vet on the quantity to feed and to be sure all items you offer are rabbit-safe. You can offer fresh food once or twice a day, simply placing them in the enclosure near your rabbit. Remove any uneaten fresh food after a few hours to prevent spoilage.%&07%You also can offer a limited amount of commercial rabbit pellets. However, overfeeding pellets can cause digestive issues and obesity.4 So be sure to discuss the feeding amount with your vet. Place a day's worth of pellets in a ceramic bowl. Discard any leftover pellets before feeding the next day's portion.%&07%Finally, rabbits should always have access to fresh water. Use either a ceramic dish or water bottle attached to the side of the enclosure (make sure your rabbit knows how to drink from the bottle), refreshing the water daily.%&07%","rabbit, general, nutrient",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rabbit.png?alt=media&token=fb4b3c52-7175-455a-8810-466c21d54413
Training Your Rabbit,The Spruce Pets,"Litter Training%&07%Most rabbits take well to litter box training, as rabbits are fairly clean animals that like to pick spots to be their toilet. Place a litter box that your rabbit can easily hop in and out of inside the rabbit’s enclosure where it’s already been relieving itself. Also make sure your rabbit always has access to a box when it’s outside its enclosure. It’s best to limit its out-of-cage area (such as to a puppy play pen) until the rabbit has learned to use a litter box. That way, it shouldn’t ever be far from a box when it must relieve itself. %&07%Besides the litter, put a handful of hay in the box, which should entice your rabbit to go in. Replace the hay daily to keep it sanitary and replace the litter every couple of days. If the box becomes too dirty, the rabbit is likely not to want to use it. Furthermore, rabbits that aren’t spayed or neutered are more likely to relieve themselves outside of the litter box to mark their territory.7%&07%Exercise%&07%Getting several hours of exercise per day is essential to keep a rabbit happy and to prevent health issues, such as obesity. Let your rabbit out of its enclosure as much as possible to allow it to roam in a safe area, as long as you're able to supervise. A minimum of four hours outside of the enclosure per day is ideal. To encourage activity, offer toys such as a tunnel for exploration or a treat ball.%&07%Reproduction/Breeding%&07%Local exotic animal veterinarians might be able to recommend a good breeder or rescue organization for you. The main benefit of a breeder is you’ll likely have a wider selection of younger animals and rarer breeds. However, don’t write off older rescue rabbits. You’ll be able to get a good sense of an older rabbit’s personality right away, and they’re often already tame around people and even litter trained. %&07%To avoid becoming an accidental breeder yourself if you’ll be bringing home multiple rabbits, discuss spaying or neutering with your vet. %&07%Common Health Problems%&07%Rabbits are prone to certain medical problems, such as:%&07%•	Digestive issues, including blockages and diarrhea%&07%•	Eye problems, such as corneal ulcers%&07%•	Respiratory infections%&07%•	Skin issues, such as mites and ﬂeas%&07%Some rabbits also might experience overgrown teeth. Rabbit teeth continuously grow and need to be worn down via their diet and chew toys. Overgrown teeth can make it difficult for a rabbit to eat and drink and typically must be trimmed by a vet.%&07%Tip%&07%Not all veterinarians accept rabbits as patients. So before acquiring a pet rabbit, make sure there is a vet near you who will be able to treat it.%&07%","rabbit, general, training, exercise, health, littering",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rabbit.png?alt=media&token=fb4b3c52-7175-455a-8810-466c21d54413
Dutch Rabbit,The Spruce Pets,"Easily found at many pet stores and popular for their classic two-toned patterns, Dutch rabbits can make wonderful pets. Like other rabbits, they do require some space to play and exercise as well as fresh green vegetables daily, but if you are looking for an interactive small pet with a personality, Dutch rabbits are worth the work. Read on to learn more about these rabbits.%&07%Species Overview%&07%Common Name: Dutch rabbit, Hollander, Brabander %&07%Scientific Name: Oryctolagus cuniculus %&07%Adult Size: 1.95-2.49 kg full grown %&07%Lifespan: 5-10 years but can live longer%&07%%&07%Dutch Rabbit Behavior and Temperament%&07%A Dutch rabbit can make a great pet for someone looking for an alternative to a cat or guinea pig, but they are more work than a typical caged pet. Rabbits are easygoing animals and are known to be playful, calm, and smart. Dutch rabbits are not aggressive creatures and are more likely to run away than to try and nip if they are scared or threatened. That means they can make great pets for adults and children alike. Like other rabbits, they are most active at dawn and dusk but can often be found lounging around and napping during the day and evening.%&07%Size Information%&07%An adult Dutch rabbit usually weighs about 4.5 pounds but can vary in weight from 3.5 to 5.5 pounds. They are considered to be small- to medium-sized rabbit and should not be confused with the smaller Netherland dwarf rabbit.%&07%Housing%&07%All rabbits, including Dutch rabbits, need a lot of space to run and play, but when they aren't hopping around, they also need a secure place to sleep. If your adult Dutch rabbit is an indoor rabbit, a minimum cage size of 3 feet by 3 feet should be provided. Store-bought cages are available, but many people create their own rabbit enclosures using exercise pens, dog crates, and other items. Outdoor rabbit hutches can also be bought or made but should be especially secure to prevent your rabbit from escaping or being injured or killed by an outside predator.%&07%Specific Substrate Needs%&07%If you choose to use a bedding in your Dutch rabbit's house, avoid cedar and pine shavings. These can be aromatic and contain oils that cause respiratory and skin irritation. Opt instead for Aspen shavings, timothy hay, or recycled paper materials if you want to provide your bunny with some soft bedding to sleep in. Litter boxes can also contain these substrates, or you can use hay or unscented, dust-free cat litter.%&07%What Do Dutch Rabbits Eat and Drink?%&07%Like other rabbits, Dutch rabbits need to eat a variety of vegetables and hay to stay healthy. Depending on the weight of your bunny, 2 tablespoons to 1/4 cup of rabbit pellets (without seeds or colored pieces) can be provided, but the majority of their meals should be composed of grass hay and dark, leafy green vegetables. You can also give them occasional treats of sugar-free cereals, crackers, fruits, and vegetables that aren't green. Remember though, that if your rabbit's diet isn't appropriate, they're more likely to develop ileus.%&07%Common Health Problems%&07%Dutch rabbits can unfortunately develop a variety of health problems. Some of the most common issues seen in rabbits include:%&07%•	Dental issues%&07%•	Ear mites and infections%&07%•	Skin mites and infections%&07%•	Eye problems%&07%•	Respiratory issues%&07%•	Ileus (gastrointestinal stasis)%&07%•	Reproductive organ issues%&07%All these health problems and many others will require the help of a veterinarian experienced in rabbit care.%&07%Training Your Dutch Rabbit%&07%Dutch rabbits are very smart and can be trained to do simple tricks, come when called, and use a litter box. Some people even teach them to walk on a rabbit harness and leash or fetch toys.%&07%Leash Training %&07%If you want to train your rabbit to walk on a leash, be sure to attach the lead to a harness that is designed for your size rabbit. Verbal coaxing, as well as treats, can help encourage your rabbit to walk towards you while getting used to being attached to a leash.%&07%Potty Training %&07%With a little patience and consistency, you can train your Dutch rabbit to use a litter box. This will make you more likely to let your rabbit roam around in a rabbit-proofed environment because you won't have to worry about cleaning up any accidents. Many rabbit owners start this potty training by hanging their rabbit's hay above the litter box so that they naturally defecate in the box as they are eating.%&07%Exercise%&07%Exercise is vital to your Dutch rabbit's mental and physical health. Your rabbit needs space to run and play so that it can be mentally stimulated through foraging for food, find things to chew on, maintain muscle mass, and keep the digestive tract moving. Gastrointestinal motility can decrease or stop because of stress and a lack of physical mobility, so it is very important to give your rabbit exercise daily.%&07%%&07%Grooming %&07%Dutch rabbits have short hair, so they are very low maintenance when it comes to grooming.%&07%Shedding%&07%Rabbits shed on a regular basis, but major molts or sheds occur twice a year in the spring and fall. During these major sheds, your Dutch rabbit will lose more fur than normal.%&07%Brushing%&07%Unless your rabbit gets something stuck in its hair or is unable to normally groom itself due to obesity, arthritis, or another medical concern, brushing is usually not necessary or recommended.%&07%Baths%&07%Rabbits are typically very clean animals so bathing them may not be necessary, but if they get messy, a quick cleaning of the soiled area is a good idea. Don't submerge your rabbit in water for baths though, only clean the areas needed. Use dish soap and lukewarm water while carefully cleaning them then towel dry them thoroughly.%&07%Be extra careful with their delicate ears and be sure to avoid spraying water into them. Dutch rabbits can easily get cold during bathes and develop ileus from stress, so bath time should not be done unless necessary.%&07%Upkeep Costs%&07%Dutch rabbits may cost more than you expect to care for. This is due to the need to provide fresh vegetables, hay, and pellets daily. Expect to spend on food and another on toys and bedding. Additionally, you'll want to budget for routine and emergency vet visits for when your rabbit requires medical attention.%&07%Pros & Cons of Keeping a Dutch Rabbit as a Pet%&07%Rabbits require a lot more space and attention than many people think, but they're also very personable pets. Dutch rabbits have unique personalities and are very calm animals. They do, however, require fresh vegetables to eat each day and can live to be over 10 years of age, so they are more of a long term commitment than some other small pets.%&07%Reproduction/Breeding%&07%If you decide to get more than one rabbit and they are of opposite sexes, you'll want to get your female spayed to prevent unwanted litters. Spaying can also help to extend the lifespan of your rabbit though since they are prone to reproductive organ cancers. Alternatively, you can get two females if you want two rabbits but if you want to get two males, you'll need to get them neutered if you want to keep them from fighting with each other.%&07%","rabbit, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rabbit.png?alt=media&token=fb4b3c52-7175-455a-8810-466c21d54413
French Lop Rabbit,The Spruce Pets,"French lop rabbits were bred from English lops and giant papillons (also known as checkered giants) so they have both the size and the floppy ears of their ancestors.

They are most active at dawn and dusk but can often be found lounging around and napping during the day and evening.%&07%Size Information%&07%French lops are big bunnies! It's normal for a French lop to weigh at least 10 pounds, but it's also not abnormal for them to weigh over 15 pounds. They also have large heads and big, floppy ears, but their ears aren't as long as their English lop ancestors.%&07%Housing%&07%All rabbits, including French lops, need a lot of space to run and play, but when they aren't hopping around, they also need a secure place to sleep. If your adult French lop rabbit is an indoor rabbit, a minimum cage size of 4.5 feet by 4.5 feet should be provided, but larger enclosures will be needed for larger French lops.

Litter boxes can also contain these substrate options, or you can use hay or unscented, dust-free cat litter.%&07%What Do French Lop Rabbits Eat and Drink?%&07%Like other rabbits, French lop rabbits need to eat a variety of vegetables and hay to stay healthy. Depending on the size of your lop, about 1/2 - 3/4 cup of rabbit pellets without seeds or colored pieces can be provided (base this off their weight and what your food recommends for that size of rabbit), but most of their meals should be composed of grass hays and dark, leafy greens. You can also give them occasional treats of sugar-free cereals, crackers, fruits, and vegetables that aren't green.

Nail trims, ear cleanings, baths, and perhaps even tooth trims may be necessary, depending on your specific rabbit and their lifestyle. Keeping the ears clean is especially important because they flop over and can easily collect debris and hold moisture.%&07%Shedding%&07%Rabbits shed on a regular basis, but major molts or sheds occur twice a year in the spring and fall. During these major sheds, your French lop will lose more fur than normal.%&07%Brushing%&07%While French lop rabbits don't have very long hair, they do have pretty dense fur so you may still need to occasionally brush them. Brushing can help decrease the amount of fur you find around the house and on your clothes, so some breeders recommend weekly brushing with a soft bristle brush.%&07%Baths%&07%Rabbits are typically very clean animals so bathing them may not be necessary, but if they get messy, a quick cleaning of the soiled area is a good idea.

Harlequin Rabbit,The Spruce Pets,"Harlequin rabbits are considered a separate breed by most but only a specific color pattern by some. Regardless of how you classify them, harlequin rabbits are known for their unique, colorful coats and can come in a variety of sizes. Knowing what kind of care they require can help keep your rabbit happy and live a long life.%&07%Species Overview %&07%Common Name: Harlequin rabbit, Japanese harlequin rabbit, Magpie harlequin rabbit %&07%Scientific Name: Oryctolagus cuniculus %&07%Adult Size: 2.95-4.31 kilograms %&07%Life Span: About 5-8 years but can live up to 12 years%&07%%&07%Harlequin Rabbit Behavior and Temperament%&07%A harlequin rabbit can make a great pet for the right person. They are easygoing animals and are known to be playful and smart. Rabbits are not aggressive creatures and are more likely to run away than to try and nip if they are scared or threatened. They are most active at dawn and dusk but can often be found lounging around and napping both during the day and evening when they're not busy playing.%&07%Size Information%&07%Harlequin rabbits can vary in size. They range anywhere from 2.95-4.31 kilograms with the females typically being a little larger than the males. They are considered a small- to medium-sized rabbit breed.%&07%Housing%&07%Rabbits need a lot of space to run and play, but when they aren't hopping around, they also need a secure place to sleep. If your harlequin rabbit is an indoor rabbit, a minimum cage size of 3 feet by 3 feet should be provided. Store-bought cages are available, but many people create their own rabbit enclosures using exercise pens, dog crates, and other items. Outdoor rabbit hutches can also be bought or made but should be especially secure to prevent your rabbit from escaping or being injured or killed by a predator.%&07%Specific Substrate Needs%&07%If you choose to use a substrate in your rabbit's house, avoid cedar and pine shavings. These can be aromatic and contain oils that can cause respiratory and skin issues. Opt for aspen or recycled paper materials instead if you want to provide your rabbit with some bedding to sleep in. Litter boxes can also contain this substrate or you can use hay or unscented, dust-free cat litter.%&07%What Do Harlequin Rabbits Eat & Drink?%&07%Like other rabbits, harlequins eat a variety of vegetables and hay. Depending on the size of your rabbit, 1/4 to 1/2 cup of rabbit pellets without seeds or colored pieces can be provided, but the majority of their meal should be composed of grass hay and dark, leafy greens. Occasional treats of sugar-free cereals, crackers, fruits, and vegetables that aren't green can also be given. Remember, if your rabbit's diet is not appropriate, it is more likely to develop ileus.%&07%Common Health Problems%&07%Harlequin rabbits can, unfortunately, develop a variety of health problems. Some of the most common issues seen in rabbits include:%&07%•	Dental issues%&07%•	Ear mites and infections%&07%•	Skin mites and infections%&07%•	Eye problems%&07%•	Respiratory issues%&07%•	Ileus%&07%•	Reproductive organ issues%&07%All these health problems and many others will require the help of a veterinarian experienced in rabbit care.%&07%Training Your Harlequin Rabbit%&07%Harlequin rabbits are very smart and can be trained to do simple tricks, come when called, use a litter box, and more. Some people even teach them to walk on a harness and leash and fetch toys.%&07%Leash Training %&07%If you want to train your rabbit to walk on a leash, be sure to attach it to a harness that is designed for a rabbit. Verbal coaxing, as well as treats, can help encourage your rabbit to walk toward you while it gets used to being attached to a leash.%&07%Potty Training %&07%With a little patience and consistency, you can train your rabbit to use a litter box. This will make you more likely to let your rabbit roam around in a rabbit-proofed environment since you won't have to worry about cleaning up any accidents.%&07%Exercise%&07%Exercise is vital to your rabbit's mental and physical health. Your rabbit needs space to run and play so that it can forage for food, be mentally stimulated, find things to chew on, maintain muscle mass, and keep its digestive tract moving. Gastrointestinal motility can decrease or stop due to stress as well as a lack of physical mobility.%&07%%&07%Grooming %&07%Harlequin rabbits have short hair but that doesn't mean they don't have grooming needs. Nail trims, ear cleanings, baths, and perhaps even tooth trims may be necessary depending on your specific rabbit and their lifestyle.%&07%Shedding%&07%Rabbits shed on a regular basis, but major molts or sheds occur twice a year in the spring and fall. During these major sheds, more fur will be lost by your rabbit than normal.%&07%Brushing%&07%While harlequin rabbits don't have very long hair, you may still need to occasionally brush them. Brushing can help decrease the amount of fur you find around the house and on your clothes.%&07%Baths%&07%Rabbits are typically very clean animals so bathing them may not be necessary, but if they get messy, a quick bath may be warranted. Use dish soap and lukewarm water while carefully cleaning your rabbit and towel dry them thoroughly.%&07%Upkeep Costs%&07%Caring for a harlequin rabbit may cost more than you expect. Due to daily fresh vegetables, hay, and pellets, expect to spend monthly for food and another on toys and bedding. Additionally, you'll want to budget for routine and emergency vet visits for when your rabbit requires medical attention.%&07%Pros & Cons of Keeping a Harlequin Rabbit as a Pet%&07%Rabbits require a lot more space and attention than many people think, but they are also very personable pets. They require fresh vegetables to eat each day but can be cuddly and live to be 12 years of age.%&07%Reproduction/Breeding%&07%The American Rabbit Breeders Association lists upcoming shows as well as harlequin rabbit breeders on their website that have paid to list their contact information. You should expect to pay depending on the color and pattern quality which can be expensive. If you decide to get more than one rabbit and they are of opposite sexes, you'll want to get your female spayed to prevent unwanted litters. Alternatively, you can get two females. If you want to get two males, you'll need to get them neutered if you want to keep them from fighting with each other.%&07%%&07%","rabbit, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rabbit.png?alt=media&token=fb4b3c52-7175-455a-8810-466c21d54413
Havana Rabbit,The Spruce Pets,"Once known as the ""fire-eye from Ingen"" and often referred to as the mink of the rabbit world, the Havana rabbit breed is over 100 years old. They got their name from the dark color of a Havana cigar but can come in several colors besides rich dark chocolate. Their incredibly soft fur makes them a popular pet but like other rabbits, Havanas need the right type of care to thrive.%&07%Species Overview  %&07%Common Name: Havana rabbit %&07%Scientific Name: Oryctolagus Cuniculus %&07%Adult Size: 4.5-6.5 kilograms %&07%Lifespan: 5-8 years but some can live to be up to 12 years of age%&07%%&07%Havana Rabbit Behavior and Temperament%&07%Havana rabbits may be popular because of their soft fur, but like other rabbits, they are also loved for their individual personalities and antics. Havanas are not aggressive, love to play and run around, and can make great family pets. They can be very affectionate and friendly and are sometimes even said to be one of the calmest rabbit breeds.%&07%Size Information%&07%Havana rabbits are small to medium-sized rabbit. Some people call them dwarf or miniature rabbits, but they are a little larger than a dwarf. They are compact as opposed to long-bodied and usually weigh around 5 pounds fully grown. Their bodies are described as being short and round.%&07%Housing%&07%You have a lot of options when it comes to housing your Havana rabbit. Outdoor rabbit hutches can be built or purchased but should be very secure to ensure your little bunny can't escape and predators can't break in. Make sure the bottom of outdoor hutches is solid and not wire-based, which can lead to feet problems. Indoor enclosures can also be purchased but since rabbits need a lot of space to run around, it is recommended to have at a cage that is at least 3 ft x 3 ft in addition to a rabbit-proofed play area in your home.%&07%Specific Substrate Needs%&07%If you choose to use a substrate in your Havana rabbit's cage, avoid cedar and pine shavings. These wood shavings can be aromatic and also contain oils that can cause respiratory and skin issues for your rabbit. Aspen shavings or recycled paper materials are better options if you want to give your bunny some bedding to sleep in or walk on. These same substrates can also be placed in your rabbit's litter box or you can use hay, paper-based beddings, or as a last option, unscented, dust free cat-litter.%&07%%&07%What Do Havana Rabbits Eat & Drink?%&07%Havana rabbits need a variety of veggies and hay in their diet in addition to fresh water. About 1/4 cup of rabbit pellets (without seeds or food coloring) should be offered each day but your rabbit should primarily eat grass hays and dark, leafy green vegetables. Less than 5 percent of their diet can consist of treats like sugar-free cereals, crackers, fruits, and vegetables that aren't green. Both a water bottle and bowl of water should be always available to encourage your rabbit to drink adequate water.%&07%Common Health Problems%&07%Havana rabbits are usually pretty healthy, but any pet rabbit is prone to developing some of the following health issues:%&07%•	Dental issues%&07%•	Ear mites and infections%&07%•	Skin mites and infections%&07%•	Eye problems%&07%•	Respiratory issues%&07%•	Ileus%&07%•	Reproductive organ issues%&07%All of these health problems and many others will require the help of a veterinarian experienced in rabbit care.%&07%Training Your Havana Rabbit%&07%Havana rabbits are great rabbits to train to play fetch, respond to their name, use a litter box, and more!%&07%Leash Training %&07%If you want to keep your rabbit close to you while still giving them some exercise outside, a harness and leash may be a good option. Make sure you choose a harness that is specifically designed for a compact rabbit's body and coax them to walk on the leash using treats until they get used to it.%&07%Potty Training %&07%Litter box training your Havana rabbit isn't very difficult and can help you keep your home clean. It will also encourage you to let your rabbit roam around the house more if you know you step in a surprise. Since rabbits like to eat and poop at the same time, putting your rabbit's hay hopper in a place where they have to sit in the litter box to eat is one of the easiest things you can do to start the potty training process.%&07%Exercise%&07%Exercise is vital to your Havana rabbit's mental and physical health. It needs ample space to run and play every day so that can forage for food, be mentally stimulated, find things to chew on, maintain muscle mass, and keep its digestive tract moving. Gastrointestinal motility can decrease or stop due to stress as well as a lack of physical mobility so if you don't give your Havana rabbit exercise, it is likely to develop serious health issues.%&07%%&07%Grooming %&07%The mink-like fur of a Havana rabbit is very easy to maintain, especially since rabbits groom themselves much like cats. Despite this, nail trims and occasional other grooming needs may arise.%&07%Shedding%&07%Havana rabbits shed on a regular basis, but major molts or sheds occur twice a year in the spring and fall. During these major sheds, more fur will be lost by your rabbit than normal, but Havana rabbit hair is very fine and short.%&07%Brushing%&07%You shouldn't have to brush your Havana rabbit on a regular basis, but it definitely doesn't hurt to use a soft brush if you want to have a bonding moment with your bunny. If your rabbit develops matting on their feet or hind ends, there is most likely an issue with the environment or a medical concern that should be addressed.%&07%Baths%&07%Since Havana rabbits will keep themselves clean on their own, unless your rabbit runs through a mess, is sick and gets a dirty hind end, or has a messy meal, you shouldn't have to bathe them. If a bath is needed though, make sure you use warm, not hot, water and don't fully immerse or get the rabbit's whole body wet—only bathe the areas that need it as they can be prone to getting cold.%&07%Upkeep Costs%&07%Caring for a Havana rabbit may cost more than you expect. Due to daily fresh vegetables, hay, and pellets, expect to spend around $50 a month on food and another $10-$20 on toys and bedding for your rabbit. Additionally, you'll want to budget for routine and emergency vet visits for when your rabbit requires medical attention.%&07%%&07%Pros & Cons of Keeping a Havana Rabbit as a Pet%&07%Rabbits require a lot more space and attention than many people think, but they are also very personable pets. Havana rabbits are easy to handle and bond with but they do require fresh vegetables to eat each day and will need their litter box cleaned regularly.%&07%Reproduction/Breeding%&07%If you decide to get more than one rabbit and they are of opposite sexes, you'll want to get your female spayed to prevent unwanted litters. Most exotic animal veterinarians will recommend spaying female rabbits (regardless of having a male or not) as it can prolong their life and keep them free of reproductive problems. Alternatively, you can get two females. If you want to get two males, you'll need to get them neutered if you want to keep them from fighting with each other.%&07%%&07%","rabbit, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rabbit.png?alt=media&token=fb4b3c52-7175-455a-8810-466c21d54413
Lionhead Rabbit,The Spruce Pets,"The lionhead rabbit is a petite breed with a distinctive fluffy wool mane similar to that of a male lion. Its body is compact, but its erect ears are rather large at around 2 to 3 inches long. Lionheads come in a wide range of colors. As pets, these rabbits are generally friendly, playful, and social, though some can be timid. They require daily interaction and a moderate amount of maintenance. They need a varied diet and housing that gives them room to exercise.%&07%Species Overview%&07%COMMON NAME: Lionhead rabbit%&07%SCIENTIFIC NAME: Oryctolagus cuniculus%&07%ADULT SIZE: 20.32 to 25.40 cm long, weighing 1.13 to 1.58 kilograms on average%&07%LIFESPAN: 7 to 10 years%&07%%&07%Lionhead Rabbit Behavior and Temperament%&07%Lionhead rabbits are generally smart, good-natured, and energetic. They love to play and socialize. And many form close bonds with their humans and enjoy cuddling and petting.%&07%However, some lionheads can be rather skittish. They typically don’t bite, but they might try to scratch you if they feel uncomfortable with handling. Most rabbits generally don’t enjoy being picked up.1%&07%To satisfy the lionhead’s social needs, it’s ideal to keep more than one rabbit. Members of the opposite sex can be kept together if they are spayed and neutered. Plus, some rabbits even form bonds with other household pets, including calm, well-mannered cats and dogs. However, it’s critical to do slow and safe introductions between animals (including other rabbits) to ensure they can coexist peacefully. %&07%As pets, rabbits are generally quiet animals that require daily feedings and regular cleanings. They also need supervised time each day outside of their enclosure to play and socialize. Plus, they should have toys—especially chew toys—in and out of their enclosure to keep them busy. Rabbits that don’t get enough mental and physical stimulation might become destructive and potentially do some unwanted chewing or digging. %&07%Size Information%&07%Lionhead rabbits stretch around 8 to 10 inches long on average and typically weigh less than 4 pounds. %&07%Housing%&07%Although the lionhead rabbit is small, it’s still an active breed that needs plenty of space to burn off energy. As a general rule, a cage for small rabbit breeds like the lionhead should be at least 18 by 24 inches and tall enough for the rabbit to stretch fully upright on its hind legs.2 However, bigger is always better, and the cage size must be increased for multiple rabbits. %&07%Avoid cages with wire bottoms, as they can harm a rabbit’s feet. A plastic-bottom dog crate can be a good option. And some owners opt for a dog exercise pen to allow for even more space while still keeping the rabbit secure. Make sure to keep the enclosure away from drafts.%&07%Within the enclosure, include food and water dishes, toys, a litter box, and a shelf onto which your rabbit can hop for exercise. You also can include tunnels and solid-floor ramps in cages that have multiple levels. Just make sure there’s enough room for the rabbit to fully stretch out with its back legs extended on the floor of the enclosure. %&07%When you allow your rabbit to roam outside of its enclosure, make sure the area is fully rabbit-proofed. Rabbits are known to chew on electrical cords and other potentially hazardous items at ground level. %&07%Specific Substrate Needs%&07%The floor of the enclosure should be nonslip. Many owners use washable carpeting to add some softness for their rabbit. Also, you can put down some straw for your rabbit to nest in. In the litter box, use dye-free paper litter; never use clumping litter. Clean the litter box at least every other day, and scrub everything in the enclosure weekly with mild soap and water. %&07%What Do Lionhead Rabbits Eat & Drink?%&07%Rabbits are herbivores. Plus, their teeth continuously grow, so they need a diet that will naturally help to wear down the teeth. %&07%Provide your lionhead with unlimited amounts of grass hay, such as timothy hay, each day. You can simply pile hay in the enclosure or use a feeder called a hopper. Make sure there is always some hay available for the rabbit.%&07%Also, offer a variety of green leafy vegetables, including lettuces, herbs, and carrot tops. And offer more limited amounts of other fruits and veggies, such as carrots. Fresh foods can simply be placed on the enclosure floor or in a small dish. You can offer them once or twice a day, but remove any uneaten fresh foods after a few hours to prevent spoilage. Consult your vet for the best quantity and variety to feed for your rabbit.%&07%Furthermore, feed a limited about of rabbit pellets. Too many pellets can result in digestive issues and obesity.3 So be sure to discuss a feeding plan with your vet. Put a day’s supply of pellets in a small ceramic bowl in the enclosure. Dispose of any uneaten pellets after 24 hours before providing the next day’s portion. %&07%Finally, make sure your rabbit always has access to fresh water. You can either use a ceramic water dish or a bottle. Just make sure the bottle is always functional and that your rabbit knows how to drink from it. Refresh the water daily.%&07%Common Health Problems%&07%Like all pet rabbit breeds, lionheads are prone to some common health issues, including:%&07%•	Digestive problems, such as blockages and diarrhea%&07%•	Eye issues, such as ulcers%&07%•	Respiratory infections%&07%•	Skin issues, such as mites and fleas4%&07%Overgrown teeth also can be a problem if your rabbit isn’t wearing them down properly via their diet and chew toys.5 You might notice your rabbit has difficulty eating or is losing weight. Vets can trim the teeth as necessary.%&07%Tip%&07%Not all veterinarians see rabbits as patients. So as you consider acquiring a lionhead rabbit, make sure there is a vet nearby who can treat it.%&07%%&07%Training Your Rabbit%&07%Litter Training%&07%Because lionhead rabbits are very smart, they often respond to litter training faster than the average pet rabbit. Providing a litter box makes cleaning the enclosure much easier, and it keeps your house sanitary when your rabbit is allowed to roam. Until your rabbit is litter trained, it’s best to confine them to a small area where there’s always a litter box nearby.%&07%Rabbits naturally tend to pick a spot to use as their bathroom. So place the litter box in that spot in the enclosure to encourage them to use it. Also, add some hay in the litter box to entice them to get in. When you see them eliminating in the box, immediately offer a treat to reinforce the behavior. %&07%Replace the hay daily to keep it sanitary and replace the litter every couple of days. Rabbits don’t like using dirty litter boxes. In addition, rabbits that aren’t spayed or neutered are likely to relieve themselves outside of the litter box to mark their territory.%&07%Exercise%&07%A minimum of four hours per day for your rabbit to exercise outside of its enclosure is ideal. Physical activity is essential to keep a rabbit fit and prevent health issues, such as obesity. Always supervise a rabbit outside of its enclosure. To encourage it to move around, make sure to offer toys, such as treat puzzles, balls, and tunnels.%&07%Grooming%&07%Lionheads have roughly 2 inches of fur around their neck with a slightly shorter coat overall. It’s a soft, thick coat that needs regular grooming. Rabbits do groom themselves but giving them some help via brushing out loose fur helps to prevent them from ingesting fur. Too much ingested fur can cause hairballs that might block a rabbit's digestive system. %&07%Brush at least a couple times per week. Give extra attention to the longer fur to prevent uncomfortable knots and mats. Lionheads also go through heavier shedding periods often in the spring and fall when you’ll likely have to brush more regularly to keep up with the loose fur. %&07%In terms of other grooming, you’ll often have to trim a rabbit’s nails, as they don’t naturally wear them down in their indoor environment. Your vet can show you how to properly do a nail trim. Baths generally won’t be necessary for a rabbit, but you can spot clean its coat as necessary by gently rubbing it with a damp cloth. %&07%Upkeep Costs%&07%Rabbits are expensive animals, especially when compared to many other small pets. Your primary costs will be their diet and bedding/litter. Plan to spend monthly on average, depending on the varieties you choose and how many rabbits you have. You’ll also have to replace worn toys and other items in the enclosure periodically. And be sure to budget for both routine veterinary care and emergencies. %&07%Pros & Cons of Keeping a Lionhead Rabbit as a Pet%&07%Lionhead rabbits are typically fun, playful, and sociable pets. They also are quiet and don’t take up a lot of space. However, they can be expensive to keep, and it’s best to have more than one to meet their social needs, which will increase your overall cost.%&07%%&07%Reproduction/Breeding%&07%Local exotic veterinarians might be able to recommend a good breeder or rescue. You also can research through the American Rabbit Breeders Association and the House Rabbit Society. The main benefit of going to a breeder is you’ll likely have a wider selection of younger animals. But because rabbits are relatively common adoptable pets, you often can find a good match at a rescue. Plus, many older animals are already tame and litter trained. %&07%To avoid accidentally becoming a breeder yourself, always spay or neuter members of the opposite sex before putting them together. %&07%%&07%%&07%","rabbit, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rabbit.png?alt=media&token=fb4b3c52-7175-455a-8810-466c21d54413
Mini Rex Rabbit,The Spruce Pets,"The mini rex rabbit is a smaller version of the rex rabbit, a breed known for its plush, velvety fur. Where an adult rex rabbit weighs around 10 pounds, a mini rex only weighs around 4 pounds. The mini rex has a compact, rounded body and comes in many different colors. As pets, these rabbits are generally calm and friendly. They require a moderate amount of upkeep that includes daily feedings and regular habitat cleanings. They also benefit from lots of socialization and playtime.%&07%Breed Overview%&07%COMMON NAME: Mini rex rabbit %&07%SCIENTIFIC NAME: Oryctolagus cuniculus%&07%ADULT SIZE: 25.4 to 30.48 cm long, weighing 1.58 to 2.04 kilograms on average%&07%LIFESPAN: 7 to 10 years%&07%%&07%Mini Rex Rabbit Behavior and Temperament%&07%While all rabbits are individuals, the mini rex breed is known for being very sweet, sociable, and easygoing.

They don’t tend to bite but might scratch if they feel uncomfortable or threatened.1%&07%Mini rex rabbits can form strong bonds with the people who care for them. It’s also ideal to keep more than one rabbit to meet their social needs. You can keep members of the opposite sex together as long as they are spayed and neutered. Plus, rabbits can even get along with other calm, well-mannered household pets, including cats and dogs. But make sure to do safe and slow introductions between any animals and avoid putting rabbits around animals that might see them as prey.%&07%While rabbits are fairly active pets, they are also relatively quiet. Expect to spend some time each day on feeding and keeping the habitat clean. And give your rabbit several hours of playtime and social time. A rabbit that is deprived of mental stimulation and physical activity often can become destructive and might do some unwanted chewing and digging.%&07%Size Information%&07%Mini rex rabbits are roughly 10 to 12 inches long and weigh less than 5 pounds. The females are often slightly larger than the males.%&07%Housing%&07%At minimum, your rabbit’s enclosure should be 18 by 24 inches and taller than your rabbit is when it stretches fully upright on its hind legs.2 Bigger is always better though, and you must add space if you have multiple rabbits in the enclosure. %&07%A cage with wire sides is ideal for ventilation, but do not select one with a wire floor, as this can be hard on a rabbit’s feet. Many owners opt for a dog crate or a dog exercise pen. Make sure the sides of the pen are high enough that your rabbit can’t hop out.  %&07%In the enclosure, add food and water dishes, toys (especially chew toys), a sturdy shelf onto which your rabbit can hop for exercise, and a litter box. Make sure there’s still enough floor space for the rabbit to fully stretch out with its back legs extended behind it. %&07%Keep the enclosure out of direct sunlight and away from drafts. Also, don’t place it in a loud, high-traffic area. But keep it somewhere nearby, as rabbits like to be close to their human families. %&07%Wherever you allow your rabbit to roam outside of its enclosure, make sure the area is totally rabbit-proofed. Rabbits love to chew and will bite on electrical cords and other potential hazards they can reach.%&07%Specific Substrate Needs%&07%The floor of your rabbit enclosure must be nonslip. Many owners put down washable rugs to add softness and make cleanup easy. You also can offer a pile of straw for your rabbit to nest in, as well as a soft blanket or towel (making sure your rabbit can’t get tangled or snagged in the material). Use dye-free paper litter in the litter box.%&07%Remove waste from the cage floor and litter box daily. Also, wash the food and water dishes daily. And once a week, scrub down everything in the enclosure with mild soap and water. %&07% Pet Rabbit Housing Giude%&07%What Do Mini Rex Rabbits Eat & Drink?%&07%The majority of your rabbit's diet should be fresh grass hay, such as timothy or oat hay. Provide an unlimited amount of hay daily, always making sure some is available to the rabbit. You can either pile the hay in the enclosure or use a special feeder called a hopper. %&07%To supplement the hay, offer fresh greens every day. Options include lettuces, herbs, radish tops, and carrot tops. Other fruits and veggies, such as carrots, can be given in smaller amounts. You can place the greens in a small ceramic dish or simply on a clean area of the enclosure floor. Many owners offer these fresh foods either once or twice a day, removing them after a few hours to prevent spoilage. Consult your vet for the proper quantity to feed, as this can vary based on size and activity level. %&07%Furthermore, offer a small amount of commercial rabbit pellets per day. But note that overfeeding pellets can cause digestive problems and obesity.3 So discuss the proper amount to feed with your vet. Place a day’s worth of pellets in a small ceramic bowl. Dispose of anything left in the bowl after 24 hours before adding the next day’s portion. %&07%Finally, always make sure your rabbit has access to clean water. You can use either a water dish or bottle. Don’t remove the dish until you’re sure your rabbit knows how to drink from the bottle, and regularly check to make sure the bottle nozzle is working. Refresh the water daily.  %&07%Common Health Problems%&07%Mini rex rabbits are prone to the same health problems as most other rabbit breeds. They include:%&07%•	Digestive problems, including diarrhea and blockages%&07%•	Eye issues, such as corneal ulcers%&07%•	Respiratory diseases%&07%•	Skin problems, such as mites and fleas4%&07%Many rabbits also experience overgrown teeth, which can make eating and drinking difficult.5 Their teeth continuously grow and must be worn down via their diet and chewing on things in their environment (such as rabbit-safe chew toys).

Rabbits tend to pick one spot as their bathroom. So to litter train them, put the litter box in that spot in the enclosure. Besides litter, add some hay to the box to entice the rabbit to go in it. When you see your rabbit using the box, treat it immediately to reinforce the behavior.%&07%If your rabbit starts to relieve itself in a different spot, move the box there or add a second box. Until your rabbit is fully litter trained, it’s best to keep it confined to a small area with a litter box always nearby. %&07%Replace the hay in the box daily and clean the litter every other day at least. Rabbits might not use the litter box if it’s dirty. Also, rabbits that aren’t spayed and neutered might relieve themselves outside of the litter box to mark their territory.%&07%Exercise%&07%Make sure your mini rex gets at least four hours per day outside of its enclosure to exercise, play, and explore.

Offer rabbit toys, food puzzles, tunnels, and more to encourage your rabbit to move.%&07%Grooming%&07%Although rabbits spend a lot of time grooming themselves, brushing your mini rex roughly once a week (or more often during seasonal shedding periods) will help to remove loose fur. Use a soft brush designed for use on rabbits, and brush gently to avoid damaging your rabbit’s delicate skin. Not only will brushing help to prevent tangles, but it also will minimize the amount of fur your rabbit ingests from self-grooming. Too much ingested fur can cause hairballs.%&07%You'll also have to periodically trim your mini rex's nails. If you're nervous about doing this task, many vet clinics will do it for you.

And older rabbits often can be a good choice because you can get a sense of their personality right away, and many are already tame, and litter trained. %&07%If you’ll be taking home rabbits of the opposite sex, discuss spaying and neutering with your vet before putting them together to prevent them from breeding.%&07%%&07%","rabbit, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rabbit.png?alt=media&token=fb4b3c52-7175-455a-8810-466c21d54413
Silver Fox Rabbit,The Spruce Pets,"Only the third rabbit breed to have been developed in the United States, the silver fox rabbit is an uncommon but beautiful breed of rabbit. The silver fox was originally known as the American heavyweight silver due to its larger size and silver- and white-tipped fur but despite the name change, these rabbits still make sturdy, affectionate pets.%&07%Species Overview %&07%Common Name: Silver Fox Rabbit %&07%Scientific Name: Oryctolagus Cuniculus %&07%Adult Size: Up to 5.44 kilograms %&07%Lifespan: Typically 5-7 years but can live up to 10 years%&07%%&07%Silver Fox Rabbit Behavior and Temperament%&07%Known to love attention and have good personalities as pets, silver fox rabbits are great for kids because they are gentle and large. They aren't small and skittish but are rather gentle and patient, which also makes them a great breed to show.%&07%Size Information%&07%Silver fox rabbits are larger than many other rabbit breeds. They can grow to be as heavy as 12 pounds, but some males will only get to be 9 pounds fully grown. This is larger than a breed standard Chihuahua or Pomeranian!%&07%Housing%&07%You have a lot of options when it comes to housing your silver fox rabbit. Outdoor rabbit hutches can be built or purchased but should be very secure to ensure your little bunny can't escape and predators can't break in. Indoor enclosures can also be purchased but since rabbits need a lot of space to run around, it is recommended to provide your silver fox rabbit with a cage that is at least 4 ft x 4 ft in addition to a rabbit-proofed play area in your home.%&07%Specific Substrate Needs%&07%If you choose to use a substrate in your silver fox rabbit's cage, avoid cedar and pine shavings. These wood shavings can be aromatic and also contain oils that can cause respiratory and skin issues for your rabbit. Aspen shavings or recycled paper materials are better options if you want to give your bunny some bedding to sleep in or walk on. These same substrates can also be placed in your rabbit's litter box or you can use hay or unscented, dust-free cat litter to help absorb urine.%&07%%&07%What Do Silver Fox Rabbits Eat & Drink?%&07%All rabbits including silver fox rabbits need a variety of veggies and hay in their diet in addition to fresh water. About 1/4 cup of rabbit pellets (without seeds or food coloring) should be offered each day, but your rabbit should primarily eat grass hays and dark, leafy green vegetables. Less than 10 percent of their diet can consist of treats like sugar-free cereals, crackers, fruits, and vegetables that aren't green. Both a water bottle and bowl of water should always be available to encourage your silver fox to drink adequate water.%&07%Common Health Problems%&07%Silver fox rabbits are usually healthy, but any pet rabbit is prone to developing some of the following health issues:%&07%•	Dental issues%&07%•	Ear mites and infections%&07%•	Skin mites and infections%&07%•	Eye problems%&07%•	Respiratory issues%&07%•	Ileus%&07%•	Reproductive organ issues%&07%All these health problems and many others will require the help of a veterinarian experienced in rabbit care.%&07%Training Your Silver Fox Rabbit%&07%Rabbits are very smart animals and can be trained to walk on a leash as well as use a litter box.%&07%Leash Training %&07%If you want to keep your rabbit close to you while still giving it some exercise outside, a harness and leash may be a good option. Make sure you choose a harness that is specifically designed for a larger rabbit's body and coax them to walk on the leash using treats until they get used to it. You should never drag your rabbit on a leash.%&07%Potty Training %&07%Litter box training your silver fox rabbit isn't very difficult and can help you keep your home clean. It will also encourage you to let your rabbit roam around the house to get more exercise if you know you won't step in a surprise. Since rabbits like to eat and poop at the same time, putting your rabbit's hay hopper in a place where they have to sit in the litter box to eat is one of the easiest things you can do to start the potty training process.%&07%Exercise%&07%Exercise is vital to any rabbit's mental and physical health. Silver fox rabbits need ample space to run and play every day so that they can forage for food, be mentally stimulated, find things to chew on, maintain muscle mass, and keep their digestive tracts moving. Gastrointestinal motility can decrease or stop due to stress as well as a lack of physical mobility, so if you don't give your silver fox rabbit exercise, it is likely to develop serious health issues.%&07%Grooming %&07%The silver fox rabbit is known for its beautiful coat, so you'll want to ensure you do your part to help keep it clean and shiny.%&07%Shedding%&07%Silver fox rabbits shed on a regular basis but major molts or sheds occur twice a year in the spring and fall. During these major sheds, more fur will be lost by your rabbit than normal.%&07%Brushing%&07%Since silver fox rabbits have longer hair than you might expect, occasional brushing to help keep the fur free of knots, debris, and food is helpful. If your rabbit develops matting on their feet or hind ends, there is most likely an issue with the environment or a medical concern that should be addressed.%&07%Baths%&07%Like cats, silver fox rabbits will keep themselves clean on their own so unless it runs through a mess, is sick and gets a dirty hind end, or has a messy meal, you shouldn't have to bathe it. If a bath is needed though, make sure you use warm, not hot, water and dish soap.%&07%Upkeep Costs%&07%Caring for a silver fox rabbit may cost more than you expect. Due to daily fresh vegetables, hay, and pellets, expect to spend on food and another on toys and bedding. Additionally, you'll want to budget for routine and emergency vet visits for when your rabbit requires medical attention or consider pet insurance.%&07%%&07%Pros & Cons of Keeping a Silver Fox Rabbit as a Pet%&07%Rabbits require a lot more space and attention than many people think, but they are also very personable pets. Silver fox rabbits are easy to handle and play with, but they do require fresh vegetables to eat each day and will need their litter box cleaned regularly.%&07%Reproduction/Breeding%&07%If you decide to get more than one rabbit and they are of opposite sexes, you'll want to get your female spayed to prevent unwanted litters. Alternatively, you can get two females. If you want to get two males, you'll need to get them neutered if you want to keep them from fighting with each other.%&07%%&07%","rabbit, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rabbit.png?alt=media&token=fb4b3c52-7175-455a-8810-466c21d54413
Velveteen Lop Rabbit,The Spruce Pets,"Like the rex breed, a velveteen lop rabbit has an extremely soft and short coat but also has big, floppy ears. This breed is popular among lop rabbit lovers and because it doesn't get as large as some lop breeds, it is a more manageable option for pet owners. Knowing the special care this breed needs can help you keep healthy and happy for years to come.%&07%Species Overview %&07%Common Name: Velveteen lop rabbit %&07%Scientific Name: Oryctolagus cuniculus %&07%Adult Size: 2.28-3.18 kilograms%&07%Life Span: About five to eight years but can live up to 12 years%&07%%&07%Velveteen Lop Rabbit Behavior and Temperament%&07%A velveteen lop rabbit can make a great pet for someone looking for an alternative to a cat or guinea pig. Rabbits are easygoing animals and are known to be playful and smart. Rabbits are not aggressive creatures and are more likely to run away than to try and nip if they are scared or threatened. That means they make great pets for adults and children alike. They are most active at dawn and dusk but can often be found lounging around and napping during the day and evening.%&07%Size Information%&07%Considered to be a medium sized rabbit, the velveteen lop rabbit maxes out around 7 pounds but their ears can grow to be over 1 foot long. As their name implies, their floppy ears are pretty big, but the rest of their body is pretty proportional.%&07%Housing%&07%All rabbits, including velveteen lops, need a lot of space to run and play, but when they aren't hopping around, they also need a secure place to sleep. If your adult velveteen lop rabbit is an indoor rabbit, a minimum cage size of 3 feet by 3 feet should be provided. Store-bought cages are available, but many people create their own rabbit enclosures using exercise pens, dog crates, and other items. Outdoor rabbit hutches can also be bought or made but should be especially secure to prevent your rabbit from escaping or being injured or killed by a predator.%&07%Specific Substrate Needs%&07%If you choose to use a substrate in your velveteen lop rabbit's house, avoid cedar and pine shavings. These can be aromatic and contain oils that cause respiratory and skin issues. Opt for aspen, timothy hay, or recycled paper materials instead if you want to provide your lop with some bedding to sleep in. Litter boxes can also contain this substrate or you can use hay or unscented, dust-free cat litter.%&07%What Do Velveteen Lop Rabbits Eat and Drink?%&07%Like other rabbits, velveteen lop rabbits need to eat a variety of vegetables and hay to stay healthy. Depending on the size of your lop, 1/4 to 1/2 cup of rabbit pellets without seeds or colored pieces can be provided (base this off their weight and what your food recommends for that size of rabbit), but the majority of their meal should be composed of grass hay and dark, leafy greens. You can also give them occasional treats of sugar-free cereals, crackers, fruits, and vegetables that aren't green. Remember, if your rabbits' diets aren't appropriate, they're more likely to develop ileus.%&07%Common Health Problems%&07%Velveteen lop rabbits can, unfortunately, develop a variety of health problems. Some of the most common issues seen in rabbits include:%&07%•	Dental issues1%&07%•	Ear mites and infections%&07%•	Skin mites and infections%&07%•	Eye problems%&07%•	Respiratory issues23%&07%•	Ileus%&07%•	Reproductive organ issues%&07%All of these health problems and many others will require the help of a veterinarian experienced in rabbit care.%&07%Training Your Velveteen Lop Rabbit%&07%Velveteen lop rabbits are very smart and can be trained to do simple tricks, come when called, and use a litter box. Some people even teach them to walk on a harness and leash or fetch toys.%&07%Leash Training %&07%If you want to train your rabbit to walk on a leash, be sure to attach the lead to a harness that is designed for your size of rabbit. Verbal coaxing, as well as treats, can help encourage your rabbit to walk toward you while getting used to being attached to a leash.%&07%Potty Training %&07%With a little patience and consistency, you can train your lop rabbit to use a litter box. This will make you more likely to let your rabbit roam around in a rabbit-proofed environment because you won't have to worry about cleaning up any accidents.%&07%Exercise%&07%Exercise is vital to your velveteen lop rabbit's mental and physical health. Your rabbits needs space to run and play so they can forage for food, be mentally stimulated, find things to chew on, maintain muscle mass, and keep digestive tracts moving. Gastrointestinal motility can decrease or stop because of stress and a lack of physical mobility.%&07%%&07%Grooming %&07%Velveteen lop rabbits have very short and soft hair but that doesn't mean they don't have grooming needs. Nail trims, ear cleanings, baths, and perhaps even tooth trims may be necessary depending on your specific rabbit and their lifestyle. Keeping a lop rabbit's ears clean is especially important because they are so large and can easily collect debris and hold in moisture.%&07%Shedding%&07%Rabbits shed on a regular basis but major molts or sheds occur twice a year in the spring and fall. During these major sheds, your rabbit will lose more fur than normal.%&07%Brushing%&07%While velveteen lop rabbits don't have very long hair, you may still need to occasionally brush them. Brushing can help decrease the amount of fur you find around the house and on your clothes. Some breeders recommend weekly brushing with a soft bristle brush.%&07%Baths%&07%Rabbits are typically very clean animals so bathing them may not be necessary, but if they get messy, a quick cleaning in the soiled area is a good idea. Don't submerge your rabbit in water for baths—only clean the areas needed as bunnies can get cold during bathes and develop ileus. Use dish soap and lukewarm water while carefully cleaning your velveteen lop rabbit and towel-dry them thoroughly. Be extra careful with their delicate ears and be sure to avoid spraying water into them.%&07%Upkeep Costs%&07%Velveteen lop rabbits may cost more than you expect to care for. This is due to needing to provide fresh vegetables, hay, and pellets daily. Expect to spend on food and another on toys and bedding. Additionally, you'll want to budget for routine and emergency vet visits for when your rabbit requires medical attention.%&07%Pros & Cons of Keeping a Velveteen Lop Rabbit as a Pet%&07%Rabbits require a lot more space and attention than many people think, but they're also very personable pets. They require fresh vegetables to eat each day but can be cuddly and sometimes even live to be 12 years of age.%&07%Reproduction/Breeding%&07%If you decide to get more than one rabbit and they are of opposite sexes, you'll want to get your female spayed to prevent unwanted litters. Fun fact, this procedure prolongs her lifespan, too! Alternatively, you can get two females if you want two rabbits but if you want to get two males, you'll need to get them neutered if you want to keep them from fighting with each other.%&07%%&07%","rabbit, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rabbit.png?alt=media&token=fb4b3c52-7175-455a-8810-466c21d54413
Common Rabbit Diseases,The Spruce Pets,"Rabbits are important parts of many families that have had the experience of caring for them. But unfortunately, and just like other pets, rabbits are prone to a variety of problems and diseases. Some diseases are more common than others but by being educated on these problems you may be able to prevent them, or at least learn to recognize the signs and symptoms more quickly in order to get your rabbit help.%&07%Rabbit Teeth Problems%&07%Rabbits have 28 teeth that help them grind their food. These teeth, unlike those of a dog or cat, grow continuously throughout the life of your rabbit. Without proper items to help keep these teeth trimmed (like hay and safe wood) the teeth can end up becoming overgrown and prevent your rabbit from being able to eat.%&07%Molar teeth (the teeth in the back of the mouth) can grow and create a bridge over the tongue which can inhibit chewing and swallowing. Teeth that become this overgrown can cause your rabbit to starve. %&07%Incisors teeth (the front teeth) will grow and start curling into the cheeks or other parts of your rabbit's mouth. This is very painful and can also cause your rabbit to stop eating.%&07%Abscessed teeth can occur due to trauma or periodontal disease and are painful to your rabbit as well. These teeth need to be extracted in order to prevent the infection that is located around the tooth from spreading throughout your rabbit's body.%&07%Rabbit Reproductive Tumors%&07%Mammary, uterine, and ovarian tumors are far too common in pet female rabbits and testicular cancer does not go unnoticed in male rabbits. Spaying and neutering pet rabbits is recommended for a variety of reasons and one of these reasons is to prevent reproductive cancers. If your rabbit is fixed their chances of developing mammary cancer is greatly diminished (and it's impossible for them to develop uterine, ovarian, and testicular cancers if these parts have been removed). Discuss the risks associated with spaying and neutering your rabbit with your veterinarian as well as an appropriate age to have it performed.%&07%Rabbit Ear Mites%&07%Rabbits are known for their large ears but these ears aren't always clean. Ear mites are small arachnids that feed off of the wax and oil that rabbit ears produce. They are irritating and cause your rabbit to itch, scratch and shake their heads. Secondary infections from ear mites also occur if the ear mites are left untreated and include bacterial and fungal infections. Large amounts of dark, crusty debris are usually seen in rabbit ears that have ear mites.%&07%Rabbits can get ear mites from direct contact with other rabbits, from being outside, and from our hands if we have recently handled an infected rabbit and then pet our own rabbit without washing. They are easy to avoid but also easy to treat. Diagnosis can be done by your veterinarian by visualizing them under a microscope but sometimes you can even see large groups of them moving with your naked eye.%&07%Rabbit Abscesses%&07%While dental disease often causes abscesses in rabbits, these pockets of pus are seen all over rabbits. They can be found internally on organs as well as in the skin layer of rabbits which makes them difficult to treat. The type of bacteria that is usually inside these abscesses is also a factor that increases the difficulty level of treatment since it doesn't need oxygen to survive.%&07%Antibiotics, cleaning out the abscess (if you can find it), and pain medications may all be prescribed for your rabbit by your veterinarian. Abscesses are serious and we don't always know why they occur but treatment is always needed as they do not go away on their own.%&07%Rabbit Ear Infections%&07%Middle or inner bacterial or fungal ear infections are a primary cause of head tilt and very common in rabbits. These infections may be difficult to detect though with a simple swab of the ear canal so treating the infection with ear medication may be done without a definitive diagnosis. Scratching at the ear, a foul odor, redness, and a drooping ear are also symptoms of an ear infection.%&07%Rabbit Ear Calcium Crystals%&07%Also experienced by some people, these tiny crystals aren't able to be visualized but cause major vertigo in rabbits. A head tilt and sometimes an inability to even stand up are experienced in rabbits with ear crystals or stones but the symptoms may disappear as quickly as they come on. Careful manipulation of the head and neck to dislodge the crystals can be performed otherwise your veterinarian may simply recommend waiting for them to move on their own.%&07%Rabbit Ileus%&07%Ileus is also known as GI stasis because it occurs when the normal peristalsis of the intestines stops. Food and hair doesn't get moved normally through your rabbit if it has ileus and gas then builds up. This causes your rabbit to be uncomfortable or painful as well as stop eating and defecating. Ileus is a life-threatening problem and needs immediate attention. Rabbits cannot typiaclly live for more than 48-72 hours if it is left untreated. Syringe feeding green vegetable baby food and water must be immediately done and a visit to your veterinarian must be made for medications and potential fluid administration. %&07%Rabbit Bumblefoot%&07%Also seen in pet rats, bumblefoot is a common problem in obese rabbits, rabbits that don't exercise, have a rough surface to sit and walk on, or who like to sit in their dirty litter boxes or bedding. It is technically referred to as pododermatitis and requires antibiotics, pain medications, a new cleaning plan for the cage, and often times dietary plans and bandaging to correct. It is very painful and your rabbit may limp or not want to walk if they have bumblefoot.%&07%What About Hairballs?%&07%Like cats, rabbits groom themselves and therefore ingest their hair. This hair is a not a problem by itself though so rabbits don't get hairballs like cats get. Their hair or fur is simply a normal part of their stomach contents. What can be problematic though, is if your rabbit ingests things it shouldn't or has ileus with dehydration.%&07%If synthetic fibers from carpeting or toys mixes with the hair in your rabbit's stomach, it can cause an obstruction and some people will incorrectly refer to these obstructions as hairballs. These obstructions are actually very rare though and are not made up of just hair. Alternatively, a dehydrated rabbit with ileus can have issues passing the normal hair in their GI tract but the hair is not the problem - the dehydration and ileus are the issues.%&07%What About E. Cuniculi?%&07%You may be wondering why Encephalitozoon cuniculi, or E. cuniculi, is not on this list of common rabbit diseases but that is because it actually isn't common at all. Historically, head tilts were thought to be a result of this protozoan but according to Dr. Karen Rosenthal, a renowed exotic veterinarian, author, and educator, that is no longer the case due to the part of the brain that we know it affects. Additionally, there is no reliable test for E. cuniculi in the United States since the antibody tests are simply showing a rabbit was exposed to it, not that it has an active infection or is causing problems in a rabbit. Veterinarians would often treat a rabbit with a head tilt with a medication called fenbendazole but this medication can cause serious liver and bone marrow issues and should not be used unless proven to be necessary.%&07%Why Do Rabbits Get Sick%&07%Like most pets, there are a number of reasons that rabbits get sick. They can be exposed to germs, eat something that causes sickness, be genetically predisposed to a condition, or other reasons. Because of their status at the low end of the food chain, rabbits typically hide signs of illness. Showing weakness puts them at risk of becoming prey. Of course, your pet probably isn't at risk of being eaten, but you still have to carefully observe it to catch early signs of sickness. Some common signs of illness include:%&07%•	Lowered energy and appetite: Rabbits show two significant signs of illness: decreased energy (or lethargy) and decreased appetite for both food and water.1 These are vague symptoms and can indicate any number of illnesses. Keep track of your rabbit's food and water consumption as it provides a quick way to spot if your pet is having health issues.%&07%•	Missing or excessive stools: Rabbit gastrointestinal stasis (RGIS) is a common rabbit illness sign that occurs when the animal stops eating.2 This slows everything in the digestive system down and the bunny stops dropping stools. GI stasis might be a result of an inadequate appetite, like a lack of fiber, dental issues, or a secondary problem such as liver disease or cancer. Diarrhea or loose stools can be a sign of trouble, too, indicating a potential parasitic or bacterial disease.%&07%•	Poor grooming habits: Bunnies are known for keeping themselves clean. Therefore, any signs that the rabbit hasn't been cleaning itself, such as fecal matter staining paws or matted fur, is a sign the rabbit is unwell. Drooling, slobby or missing hair on the creature's hair and neck are also all indicators of illness, potentially dental disease. Additionally, dandruff, overall fur loss, or a scaly coat can be a sign of an infection that could be contagious to other animals or even humans, such as in the case of ""the walking dandruff mite,"" Cheyletiella parasitovorax.3%&07%•	Cold symptoms: Rabbits can only breathe through their noses, so an upper respiratory tract disease is a serious health problem. If it looks like your rabbit is suffering from a cold with symptoms like nasal discharge, sneezing, coughing, breathing problems, including open-mouth breathing, it needs to be seen by a vet ASAP.%&07%•	Head tilt. If your bunny's head is listing to one side, the eye on that side seems to be having issues, or the rabbit has poor coordination, it could be suffering from a sudden onset of head tilt, a dysfunction of the system that controls the rabbit's balance.4%&07%Treatment%&07%The treatment that a vet will prescribe will depend on the condition that the rabbit has. While you seek treatment, try to keep your rabbit hydrated and warm. A syringe with water or soft foods (applesauce or baby food) can assist. Depending on the condition, your vet may prescribe prescription medication to help your rabbit's condition. Illness can happen quickly with rabbits so make sure you have a vet that treats rabbits. Like other pets, rabbits should visit a vet at least once a year until age 4, when the visit should be scheduled for every 6 months. A vet has specialty knowledge that can catch rabbit illness signs before they blossom into a bigger health issue.%&07%How to Prevent Illnesses%&07%It's not entirely possible to prevent illnesses in rabbits. Practicing prevention will help. Feed them a healthy diet, provide a clean and loving environment, and take care to avoid extreme temperatures. Touching their bodies is just as important as monitoring their behavior for any illnesses. Your hands will let you know about any changes in body condition, and you'll spot lumps or injuries early. It's not as time-consuming as you might think. Rabbits will quickly adapt to physical attention and you'll get used to tending to them.%&07%%&07%%&07%%&07%","rabbit, diseases",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rabbit.png?alt=media&token=fb4b3c52-7175-455a-8810-466c21d54413
Rabbit Behavior and Body Language,The Spruce Pets,"Pet rabbits have bigger personalities than most people give them credit for. People who have never had a pet rabbit may not understand that each rabbit has its own unique personality. All rabbits do things to communicate that they are happy, sad, or scared and while every rabbit is different, certain behaviors mean the same thing for most rabbits.%&07%Rabbit Binkying%&07%Rabbits binkying look a bit like a person gleefully jumping into the air and clicking their heels together. While rabbits don't actually do that Fred Astaire heel click, they do leap into the air and twist their bodies to show that they are happy or excited. Someone who doesn't know what a binky looks like may think that their rabbit is scared and running away or that something else is wrong with them but a binky is a very normal, natural thing for a happy rabbit to do. All rabbit owners should have bunnies happy enough to binky. %&07%Rabbit Digging%&07%Rabbits are natural diggers. Their wild cousins dig burrows for nesting and to make their homes and our house rabbits dig for fun. This is an instinctual behavior but it can be bothersome and destructive for their humans that love them. Rabbits will also dig on your feet or hands to get your attention. Digging is normal! %&07%The Bunny Zoom%&07%If your rabbit has ever run around the room as fast as they can as though something is chasing them then you've witnessed the bunny zoom. This behavior is a happy one and your bunny is zooming around out of pure excitement. Perhaps they are playing with you or a furry friend or are expecting a favorite treat. Regardless of the reason, the bunny zoom is not only entertaining to watch but you can rest assured knowing that this means your rabbit is one happy bunny. %&07%Rabbit Flopping%&07%Some people get nervous when they see their rabbits flop over onto their sides but this flopping is a sign of a content rabbit. Usually, your rabbit will be resting, sitting up, and then roll onto its side to lie down. This flopping motion is much different than a seizure because your rabbit will be very relaxed, their eyes will most likely be closed and their legs will not be moving. Flopping is a normal rabbit behavior and it means your rabbit is relaxed.%&07%Rabbit Noises%&07%Rabbits are social and while most people who have never owned a rabbit have never heard a rabbit make a noise you can rest assured that they have their own vocabulary to tell us and each other how they feel. Some noises are very obvious such as screaming. A rabbit will only scream if they are scared, stressed, or frightened.1 You will hopefully never hear a rabbit scream.%&07%Other less alarming noises include a buzz or honk noise, which can mean they are excited and is usually done while they are circling and sniffing another rabbit, and teeth grinding. Teeth grinding can mean your rabbit is uncomfortable or in pain but it can also mean they are content. If the teeth grinding (also referred to as purring) is heard while your rabbit is sitting up, hunched, and not moving then it most likely signifies they are in pain.2 If it is heard very softly while your rabbit is relaxed, such as after flopping, then it means they are relaxed.%&07%Growling is another noise that you may hear if you have a territorial rabbit or if they are angry or stressed out. Neutering or spaying your rabbit will help to relieve any territorial tendencies but you may still hear growling if you are trying to introduce a new rabbit to your bunny.3 If you hear growling you should separate the rabbits because a growl is an indication that a fight or other type of aggressive behavior may occur.%&07%Rabbit Kicking%&07%Rabbits can deliver a very strong kick if they want to. They have powerful hind legs and if they are displeased they may kick to try to get away or indicate they want to be put down if they are being held. If your rabbit appears to kick as they hop away from you they are trying to kick up dirt to show they are upset. If a rabbit is kicking while you are holding them then you should carefully set them down because they can hurt or paralyze their back if they kick hard enough while being held.3%&07%Rabbit Nose Bonking and Nudging%&07%If your bunny is nudging his nose on its toys—or on you—it is because this is their way of exploring and investigating things. Just like sharks bonk and nudge to get an idea of what it is they are looking at, rabbits have very sensitive little noses that help them discover what makes up their environments. Sometimes a bonk or nudge is followed by a nip to further test it out or to indicate that the rabbit wants you to move or pay attention to you.%&07%Biting Rabbits%&07%Rabbits may give you an innocent nip to get your attention but they can also bite to show dominance, out of fear, or to say they don't like something/someone. Rabbits may bite each other if they are fighting or if an established rabbit doesn't like a new rabbit, out of sexual frustration or to establish a hierarchy with the other rabbits they live with, or simply because they don't want to do something if you are trying to pick them up or put them in a cage. Rabbits aren't usually aggressive and neutering or spaying can help resolve any aggressive tendencies.3%&07%Thumping Rabbits%&07%A rabbit that thumps their hind leg is an upset rabbit. Thumping is a sign that is meant to warn other rabbits that there is something in the area to avoid. Thumping can mean danger is near or that they are mad or feel threatened.%&07%Licking Rabbits%&07%Rabbit tongues are just the cutest and the little licks that rabbits give are no different. They may not be kissers like dogs but they are often seen grooming themselves or their rabbit friends with their cute little pink tongues. This is very normal behavior but if a rabbit ingests too much hair it can cause a problem.2 Be sure to help your rabbit with their grooming regimen by regularly combing or brushing them.%&07%Rabbit Chinning%&07%Rabbits have scent glands on their face like many other animals. Sometimes rabbits will rub their chin on something (referred to as chinning) to tell other rabbits that the object is theirs. This is a normal way of marking their territory.%&07%%&07%","rabbit, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rabbit.png?alt=media&token=fb4b3c52-7175-455a-8810-466c21d54413

General Care for a Pet Guinea Pig,The Spruce Pets,"Guinea pigs are a species of rodent that enjoys great popularity as an exotic pet. There are several varieties of guinea pigs with different coat types and color patterns. The most common are the American (short, smooth coat), Abyssinian (short coat with swirls called rosettes), and Peruvian (long coat). There also are hairless varieties called skinny pigs. As pets, guinea pigs are typically friendly and docile. Their care is moderately time-consuming but straightforward. Their housing is easy to set up and maintain, and their diets are readily available at most pet stores. %&07%Species Overview%&07%COMMON NAMES: Guinea pig, cavy, domestic cavy%&07%SCIENTIFIC NAME: Cavia porcellus%&07%ADULT SIZE: 20.32 to 48.46 cm long, weighing 0.90 to 1.36 kg%&07%LIFESPAN: 6 to 8 years; some live up to 10 years%&07%%&07%Guinea Pig Behavior and Temperament%&07%Guinea pigs are social animals, so it's recommended to keep them in same-sex pairs or small groups to prevent loneliness and boredom.1 A pair of females is the better option, as two males will sometimes fight, especially if they're not neutered. It's best not to let your guinea pig interact with other pets in the household—especially any predatory animals such as dogs, cats, and ferrets—as they can be easily injured.%&07%As pets, guinea pigs might be nervous at first, but they rarely bite. With frequent handling, they generally become tame and comfortable being picked up and carried around. Guinea pigs will bond with the people who take care of them most, and many enjoy cuddling with their owners. Some also will squeal out of excitement when they see their favorite people. Guinea pigs have a range of personalities, from shy to outgoing. But overall they are gentle and affable pets. %&07%Moreover, while they're usually quiet animals, guinea pigs can make some fairly loud vocalizations, especially when they're squealing for excitement about a meal. They also sometimes make a deep purring sound when they're relaxed. They're typically active during the day, though they occasionally wake up and move around at night. So you might not want to keep their enclosure in your bedroom if you're a light sleeper.%&07%Guinea pigs can be a greater time commitment than some people might expect from such a small animal. Plan to spend at least a few hours per day giving your pet attention out of its enclosure, allowing it to exercise and explore. And in addition to daily feedings, expect to spend time cleaning the enclosure at least once a week. %&07%Size Information%&07%Guinea pigs stretch between 8 and 19 inches long on average. And they weigh around 2 to 3 pounds. They grow rapidly during their first four months and then fully fill out at around a year old.%&07%","rodents, general, grooming",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rodents.png?alt=media&token=dc6fe76f-764b-4c31-96f0-789b741c2818
Housing for Guinea pigs,The Spruce Pets,"Guinea pigs need as large of a cage as you can fit and afford. Many pet shop cages marketed for guinea pigs are too small. Remember their cage is their primary space for exercise unless you're able to take your pet out and monitor it for most of the day. One of the best options is a cage with a plastic base and wire top, which allows for good airflow.%&07%One guinea pig should have a cage that is at least 30 inches by 36 inches. For two guinea pigs, get a cage that's at least 30 inches by 50 inches. A height of around 18 inches is fine. The floor space is more important than the height, as guinea pigs generally don’t climb.%&07%In the cage, add a small animal hideout or nest, which you can find at most pet stores, where your guinea pig can go to feel secure and rest. And add some guinea pig toys for chewing and play, which also are available at most pet stores.%&07%Place the cage in a quiet part of your home. Loud noises and sudden movements can easily stress a guinea pig. Also, make sure the cage is out of direct sunlight and away from drafts.%&07%Specific Substrate Needs%&07%Always use a cage with a solid bottom and not a wire grate, as this can damage the feet of a guinea pig. Add a 2-inch layer of paper bedding at the bottom. Avoid cedar and pine bedding, which can irritate a guinea pigs respiratory system.","rodents, general, shelter",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rodents.png?alt=media&token=dc6fe76f-764b-4c31-96f0-789b741c2818
Guinea pigs Nutrient,The Spruce Pets,"Guinea pigs are herbivores, meaning they eat plants. Offer your guinea pig an unlimited amount of timothy hay every day. You can simply lay this in the enclosure or use a special feeder known as a hayrack. Just make sure some is always available. This aids digestion and helps to wear down their teeth, which grow continuously.%&07%Also, select a commercial pelleted food formulated for guinea pigs to feed each day. The pellets should be fortified with vitamin C, as guinea pigs cannot produce this vitamin on their own.1 Follow the package instructions for how much to feed. Many owners put a day’s worth of pellets in a small bowl in their guinea pig’s enclosure in the morning and dispose of any uneaten pellets before the next day’s feeding. Opt for a ceramic bowl over a plastic or stainless steel one, so your guinea pig won't be able to tip it over.%&07%To supplement the hay and pellets, offer a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables each day in another small bowl separate from the pellets. You can feed these at any point during the day, but they should not exceed 10 percent of the total daily diet. Some good options include romaine lettuce, kale, and cilantro, as well as carrots, zucchini, kiwi, and blueberries. Keep the sugary fruits to a minimum as a treat just a few times a week. And always consult your veterinarian to make sure you're feeding the appropriate quantity and variety of foods.%&07%Finally, guinea pigs always need access to clean water. Aim to get your guinea pig using a water bottle that attaches to the side of the enclosure as soon as possible. Water bottles won't spill or become contaminated like a water dish can. But don't remove the water dish until you're sure your animal is consistently drinking from the bottle.","rodents, general, nutrient",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rodents.png?alt=media&token=dc6fe76f-764b-4c31-96f0-789b741c2818
Training a Guinea pigs,The Spruce Pets,"Litter Training%&07%Some guinea pigs can be trained to use a litter box. Select a small litter box with short walls and fill it with a different bedding from what you use in the rest of the cage. Also, it can be helpful to add some soiled bedding. Place the litter box in a spot where your guinea pig tends to relieve itself and treat it when it jumps in and explores the box. Then, treat it every time you see it relieving itself in the box. If it starts relieving itself in a new spot instead, move the litter box there (or get a second box if you can fit it). Eventually your guinea pig might start to see the box as its toilet. %&07%Exercise%&07%Regular exercise is essential for guinea pigs to help prevent obesity and other health issues. Playing with your guinea pig in a secure area outside of the enclosure for a few hours per day will help it get both physical activity and mental stimulation. Plus, within the enclosure it can be helpful to place the sleeping area on one side and the food on another, so your guinea pig has to get up and move around. Selecting an enclosure with a second level accessible via a ramp (with a solid floor, not wires) also can encourage physical activity. %&07%Grooming%&07%As part of their care, guinea pigs need regular grooming at least weekly (or more often for longhaired guinea pigs). Brush out any mats and loose fur with a small, stiff brush or comb. Also, aim to clip your guinea pig's nails once every two weeks, or they can become overgrown and affect the animal's ability to walk.5 Your vet can show you how to do a nail trim if necessary.%&07%Upkeep Costs%&07%On a monthly basis, your main costs for a guinea pig will be its food and bedding. You’ll periodically have to replace nests and toys. And be sure to budget for an annual veterinary checkup as well as emergency medical care.%&07%Pros & Cons of Keeping a Guinea Pig as a Pet%&07%Guinea pigs are mostly quiet pets that don’t take up a lot of space. They’re also quite entertaining, and some can be very friendly and cuddly. However, they are social animals, and it’s ideal to keep more than one at a time, which adds to both their cost and upkeep. Plus, they are prone to some health problems and require a vet who specializes in guinea pigs.%&07%Purchasing or Adopting Your Guinea Pig%&07%Pet stores are a common source for pet guinea pigs. However, you're better off going to a reputable breeder or rescue organization, which typically will be able to give you more detailed information on the animal's origin, health, and temperament. Plus, good breeders and rescues tend to handle their guinea pigs regularly, which helps to keep them tame. Make sure any seller houses male and female guinea pigs separately, or there could be a chance you'll take home a pregnant female. %&07%Reproduction/Breeding%&07%Local exotic veterinarians might be able to point you in the direction of a good guinea pig breeder or rescue. The main benefit of a breeder is it will typically have a wider selection of animals or a particular variety you’re looking for. Look for a guinea pig that is active, alert, and in good body condition. If the seller says it's tame, then ask to handle it. The guinea pig should relax fairly quickly when you hold it. %&07%To avoid accidentally becoming a breeder yourself, keep multiple guinea pigs in same-sex groups. Some vets also will spay and neuter guinea pigs.%&07%%&07%","rodents, general, training, exercise, health, littering",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rodents.png?alt=media&token=dc6fe76f-764b-4c31-96f0-789b741c2818
Himalayan Guinea Pig,The Spruce Pets,"Guinea pigs are very popular pets. Not only do they make great family pets because they are the perfect size for children, but they also come in a variety of beautiful fur patterns that appeal to people of all ages. One such fur pattern is called Himalayan and this pattern describes a uniquely colored guinea pig.%&07%Himalayan guinea pigs are albino cavies; they have all white fur and red eyes. These guinea pigs are not a separate species from other guinea pigs but are instead a specific breed. What makes them different, though, is the fur on their face, ears, and feet which is black or brown. Many refer to Himalayan guinea pigs as the Siamese cats of the guinea pig world because of their similar characteristic markings referred to as points.%&07%Species Overview%&07%COMMON NAME(S): Himalayan Guinea Pig%&07%SCIENTIFIC NAME: Cavia porcellus%&07%ADULT SIZE: 20.32-25.40 cm long, 0.68-1.13 kg.%&07%LIFESPAN: Average lifespan in captivity is 4-5 years, but it is not uncommon to have one that lives up to 8 years1. The longest-lived guinea pig was recorded to be 14 years old, but this is very rare.%&07%%&07%Himalayan Guinea Pig Behavior and Temperament%&07%Like other guinea pigs, Himalayans are very social pets. They thrive when they live with other guinea pigs and love interaction with their owners, too. When they are used to being handled, they enjoy being pet, talked to, and snacking on their favorite treats. Guinea pigs are not aggressive animals but as with any pet, if they are frightened, hurt, or startled, they can nip.%&07%Size Information%&07%Himalayan guinea pigs are a standard-sized guinea pig. Most guinea pigs grow to be about 8-10 inches in length and weight about 1.5 to 2.5 lbs. when they are full grown. They are short animals that do not have tails.%&07%Housing%&07%When it comes to housing your Himalayan guinea pig, you should pay special attention to the flooring of their habitat. Guinea pigs can get their tiny feet stuck in wire cage bottoms or develop infections and problems, such as bumblefoot, if the floor is too dirty. Choose a large enclosure with a solid floor. The height of the cage is not important because guinea pigs don't jump or climb but you should have at least 2 x 5 ft of floor space for two cavies. Additionally, make sure your guinea pig can't get its head stuck in the bars of the cage or escape.%&07%Specific Substrate Needs%&07%Because Himalayan guinea pigs are primarily white, avoid cage bedding that is dyed or has newspaper ink on it because these items are likely to discolor your pig. Additionally, avoid pine and cedar wood shavings; they can be irritating to your cavy's respiratory tract. Opt instead for paper beddings that are free of dyes and that will help absorb urine.%&07%What Do Himalayan Guinea Pigs Eat & Drink?%&07%All guinea pigs are herbivores, so they only eat plants. An adult Himalayan guinea pig's diet should be primarily made up of grass hays, such as Timothy or Orchard, with guinea pig pellets, fresh vegetables, and fresh fruits rounding out their meals. It is vital to ensure adequate vitamin C is consumed by your guinea pig, so be sure to pay attention to the expiration date of your guinea pig's pellets so this vitamin doesn't expire before your cavy can reap its benefits. Additionally, give vitamin C treats to supplement this essential vitamin. You can also feed vitamin C rich vegetables, such as bell peppers! Finally, fresh drinking water should always be provided. While some water is consumed from the fruits and veggies your pig will eat, a water bottle and bowl of water should also be readily available.%&07%Common Health Problems%&07%Guinea pigs can have health problems with their teeth and develop bladder stones, bumblefoot, lice, respiratory diseases, scurvy, broken legs, ileus, diarrhea, conjunctivitis, uterine cancer, ovarian cysts, pyometra, and more. Regular/yearly check-ups with a vet that is comfortable treating pockets pets is recommended.%&07%Exercise%&07%It's important to your guinea pig's physical and mental health to spend time outside the cage. Make sure you provide a safe place for your guinea pig to run around on a regular basis. Wheels and balls that hamsters commonly use are not ideal for guinea pigs. Consider an X-pen to keep them outside of their cage safely to roam around.%&07%Grooming %&07%Himalayan guinea pigs have short hair, so grooming is limited to the occasional cleaning of feet, the hind end, and bathing when necessary. Hair trimming is needed but some guinea pigs may need their nails trimmed.%&07%Baths%&07%If you must bathe your guinea pig, be careful they don't get too cold while wet or overheat it when drying it. Use lukewarm water and a gentle shampoo or soap to bathe (dish soap is harsh on the skin and isn't recommended by small mammal veterinarians) and when it's time to dry your cavy, towel dry it. Avoid using a hairdryer as this can easily overheat your pig.%&07%Upkeep Costs%&07%Guinea pigs require fresh bedding on a weekly basis, plentiful hay, pellets designed for guinea pigs, and some fresh fruits and veggies. Veterinary visits for an examination and are recommended at least yearly. If your veterinarian finds problems at the visit, testing and medications will be additional costs.%&07%%&07%Pros & Cons of Keeping a Himalayan Guinea Pig as a Pet%&07%Guinea pigs are not the kind of pet that you take on a walk, but they are interactive and social. They also live longer than most hamsters but not as long as a dog or a cat. They are easy to care for but require regular cleaning, fresh food preparation, and attention. They do make noises so they aren't as quiet as a rabbit, but they also aren't as loud as a bird.%&07%Reproduction/Breeding%&07%If you have a male and female guinea pig, it is very likely that they will try to breed therefore it is recommended to house two females together, unless you plan to have your female cavy spayed. Guinea pigs usually only have one or two babies, but the birth can be very stressful and even life threatening for the mother. Female guinea pigs must be bred by the time they are only a few months old, otherwise their pubic symphysis fuses and a C-section will be necessary to save both the mother and the babies.%&07%%&07%","rodents, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rodents.png?alt=media&token=dc6fe76f-764b-4c31-96f0-789b741c2818
Teddy Guinea Pig,The Spruce Pets,"Guinea pigs are large rodents that don't have tails, and their fur can come in a variety of textures and colors. Teddy guinea pigs are a specific breed with coarse, short fur that doesn't require much grooming. They are slightly smaller than the main species and tend to be very friendly and docile. They require a moderate amount of care, though it is straightforward.

They're most active during the day but also sometimes move around at night. Guinea pigs are social animals and should ideally be kept in same-sex pairs or small groups. Keeping females together is the better option, as males sometimes will fight. Moreover, keep your guinea pigs away from other household pets to avoid any stress and injuries.%&07%Guinea pigs also typically enjoy interaction with people, especially when handled from a young age. They can be skittish at first, though they are usually not aggressive and rarely bite. They’ll generally bond with the people who care for them the most, and many come to enjoy petting, being held, and cuddling with their owners. They also might squeal with excitement when they see their favorite people.%&07%They are largely quiet animals, but they do have a range of vocalizations that they use to communicate their moods. For instance, they might make a purring sound when they’re content. %&07%Plan to spend a few hours each day giving your guinea pig attention and letting it out of its enclosure for exercise and mental stimulation. In addition to daily feedings, you’ll also have to allot some time each week to clean the enclosure. %&07%Size Information%&07%Teddy guinea pigs stretch around 10 to 12 inches long on average and weigh between roughly 1.5 and 3 pounds. The females are usually slightly smaller than the males.%&07%Housing%&07%As a rule, guinea pigs should have as large of a cage as you can fit and afford. Remember this will be their primary area for exercise unless you’re able to let your guinea pig out of its cage and safely monitor it for most of the day. %&07%A cage for one guinea pig should be at least 30 by 36 inches. For two guinea pigs you’ll need one that’s at least 30 by 50 inches. Guinea pigs typically don’t climb, so a height of around 18 inches should be fine. Cages with a plastic base and wire walls and top are ideal because they allow for good air flow. Just make sure the flooring is not wire, as this can harm a guinea pig’s feet.%&07%Within the cage should be a nest or some other type of guinea pig-sized shelter, which you can find at many pet stores. Also, include some guinea pig toys for play and chewing.%&07%Keep your guinea pigs habitat away from drafts and direct sunlight. Also, don’t put it in a high-traffic area with lots of movement and loud noises, as this can be stressful.%&07%Specific Substrate Needs%&07%Add around 2 inches of dye-free paper bedding to the bottom of the enclosures. Avoid pine and cedar beddings1, as they can be harmful to a teddy guinea pigs respiratory tract. Change the bedding weekly when you wash down the cage with mild soap and water.%&07%What Do Teddy Guinea Pigs Eat & Drink?%&07%Teddy guinea pigs eat a plant-based diet. Provide an unlimited amount of timothy hay every day. This aids digestion and helps to wear down their continuously growing teeth. You can use a special feeder called a hayrack in the enclosure or simply lay the hay somewhere accessible. %&07%Then, feed a commercial pelleted guinea pig diet. Make sure the pellets are fortified with vitamin C, as guinea pigs can’t produce that on their own.2 Follow the package label for how much to feed and confirm that with your vet.

Some options include kale, carrots, zucchini, and blueberries. %&07%Finally, always provide clean water for your guinea pig. Using a water bottle attached to the enclosure is best, as it’s easy to keep sanitary. But until you’re sure your guinea pig is drinking from the bottle, also include a small water dish. Refresh the water daily.%&07%Common Health Problems%&07%Teddy guinea pigs are prone to a few health problems, including:%&07%•	Respiratory diseases: These are often bacterial infections that can cause difficulty breathing, loss of appetite, and more.%&07%•	Skin parasites: Parasites, such as mites and lice, can affect guinea pigs and might cause itching and hair loss.%&07%•	Dental issues: Overgrown teeth and other problems in the mouth can cause difficulty eating, drooling, weight loss, and even sinus infections.%&07%•	Eye issues: Guinea pigs can get eye infections, such as pink eye, as well as scratches and other issues.%&07%•	Tumors: Older guinea pigs more commonly develop various tumors compared to younger guinea pigs.%&07%•	Bumblefoot: Also known as pododermatitis, bumblefoot is a foot infection that can be caused by a wire cage floor, poor sanitation, obesity, or injury.%&07%•	Scurvy: If your teddy guinea pig doesn't receive enough vitamin C, it can develop a condition called scurvy with symptoms that include weakness, difficulty moving, and lethargy.3%&07%•	Bladder stones: Guinea pigs can develop bladder stones that make it difficult to urinate and might need to be surgically removed.4%&07%Tip%&07%Not all veterinarians take guinea pigs as patients. So as you consider one as a pet, be sure to find a vet nearby who treats guinea pigs.%&07%%&07%Training%&07%Litter Training%&07%Some guinea pigs can learn to use a litter box with some training. Select a litter box that your guinea pig can easily get in and out of and fill it with a different bedding from what you have in the rest of the enclosure. If possible, add some soiled bedding as well. Position the litter box in a spot where your guinea pig often receives itself. Treat it whenever you see it exploring the box and anytime you catch it relieving itself in the box.%&07%If your guinea pig instead picks a new spot to relieve itself, try moving the box there. You also can get a second box if your enclosure has the space. While there are no guarantees to this process, eventually your guinea pig might come to see the box as its toilet. %&07%Exercise%&07%Daily exercise is essential to help prevent obesity and other health issues in teddy guinea pigs. Let your guinea pig out of its enclosure for at least a few hours a day to explore in a secure room. Make sure to keep cords and other potentially hazardous objects out of its reach, and always supervise it outside of the enclosure.%&07%Also, to prevent your guinea pig from getting lazy, it can be helpful to put its food and its sleeping area on opposite sides of its habitat. That way, it must get up and move around whenever it wants a bite to eat. Cages with multiple levels accessible via solid-floor ramps also are helpful to promote physical activity.%&07%Grooming%&07%Brush teddy guinea pigs weekly with a stiff brush or comb. Hair trimming typically won’t be necessary thanks to their short coat. Their hair should be plush and a little coarse when well groomed.

They aren't loud like a barking dog or squawking parrot, but they can be vocal in their own ways. Like other guinea pigs, texels can make a variety of noises but that's mostly due to the fact that they are also very social. They do best when housed with another guinea pig, love being pet and handled, and even develop their own personalities. They aren't typically aggressive and some even love to be cuddled.%&07%Size Information%&07%Texel guinea pigs are small yet sturdy pets that average about two pounds in weight. They have short legs and bodies described as being cobby and eight to ten inches long. They are easy pets for children to hold in their laps or adults to carry.%&07%Housing%&07%Guinea pigs may not be very big but that doesn't mean they should be housed in a hamster cage. Texel guinea pigs need at least a 30 inches x 36 inches enclosure, but since they shouldn't be housed alone, it is more likely that your enclosure is going to be at least two 30 inches x 50 inches. This size enclosure will allow two guinea pigs to have enough space to play, eat, and sleep. Floor space is more important than height.%&07%Specific Substrate Need%&07%Bedding in your guinea pig's enclosure will help absorb urine and spilled water. Recycled paper substrates and aspen wood shavings are good choices. Avoid pine and cedar beddings as they can irritate your guinea pigs respiratory system.%&07%What Do Texel Guinea Pigs Eat & Drink?%&07%Texel guinea pigs should be fed a variety of foods. The bulk of their diet (70%) should be grass hay and fresh, leafy green vegetables (8%). Minimal fruits and daily pellets (20%) fortified with vitamin C should also be offered. Treats should make up no more than 2% of your guinea pig's diet.%&07%Fresh drinking water should be always available. Your guinea pig's diet should be supplemented with vitamin C—if using a liquid vitamin C supplement, be sure to change the water every day. Other options for vitamin C include cookie or treat forms. If using vegetables for vitamin C supplementation, consider adding in water or treat forms as well as most guinea pigs don't eat enough foods with vitamin C in them to get the amount they need. Both a water bottle and bowl should be provided to encourage your texel to drink as much water as possible.%&07%Common Health Problems%&07%Texel guinea pigs are susceptible to a variety of health problems. The most seen issues include:%&07%•	Ileus%&07%•	Uroliths%&07%•	Ectoparasites%&07%•	Uterine and ovarian diseases%&07%•	Respiratory issues%&07%Training Your Texel Guinea Pig%&07%Guinea pigs are smart so some people may be surprised to find out that you can train your guinea pig to do a few things.%&07%Leash Training %&07%If you want to take your texel guinea pig outside, getting them used to wearing a harness and a leash can be beneficial. Don't expect to take your cavy for a walk, but a harness and leash can help keep them safe and prevent you from losing them. Select a harness that is designed for a guinea pig's body and have your guinea pig wear it for a few minutes each day while offering treats. Once your pig is comfortable walking around in it, attach the leash.%&07%Potty Training %&07%Litter box training your guinea pig is possible with some persistence and patience. Guinea pigs don't take to a litter box as naturally or easily as a cat or rabbit, but if you place the litter box in your cavy's favorite spot to go potty and then reward when you see them using the box, you may get lucky.%&07%Exercise%&07%Texel guinea pigs need ample space to run around. This is not only important for their muscular health but also for their mental stimulation, overall happiness, and gastrointestinal health. Be sure to allow your guinea pig time and space to have a little fun.%&07%Grooming %&07%When it comes to grooming, short-haired guinea pigs are a little easier to manage than long-haired ones, but that doesn't mean it's difficult to keep your texel looking great.%&07%Shedding%&07%Texel guinea pig hair does shed but since guinea pigs are small pets, it's not a burdensome amount. Expect to find a little fur on your clothes or floor after handling your guinea pig.%&07%Brushing%&07%Texel guinea pigs have beautiful hair, but it needs a little help to keep it looking good. Weekly brushing of their long, wavy fur will help keep it from matting and getting food or bedding stuck in it.%&07%Baths%&07%Occasional baths may be necessary to keep your texel clean. Since this breed of guinea pig has such long hair, it's easy for it to collect food, urine, and feces as your cavy walks around. When bathing your guinea pig, use a guinea pig-safe shampoo and don't allow the water to get too hot or cold. Spot cleaning or bathing sections of your guinea pig is better than getting them wet completely as they can get cold easily.%&07%Nail Trims%&07%Most guinea pigs need to have their nails trimmed about once every month or so. If your guinea pig runs around outside on rougher surfaces, this may not be needed as often.%&07%Upkeep Costs%&07%Food and bedding for guinea pigs will be ongoing costs, so you should plan expenses on bedding and food for each guinea pig you own. Since guinea pigs need fresh veggies in addition to their hay and pellets, plan on visiting the grocery store on a regular basis. You should also budget for veterinary visits as well as periodic toy and enclosure replacements.%&07%Pros & Cons of Keeping a Texel Guinea Pig as a Pet%&07%Caring for a texel guinea pig provides you with a personable, fluffy pet that can learn their name and be fun to play with. They can live up to 10 years and are easy to care for. They do, however, require regular enclosure cleanings, fresh food, and water every day, and should be housed with another guinea pig. This means you shouldn't ever have just one guinea pig so if you want a cavy, plan for two of them.%&07%Reproduction/Breeding%&07%Guinea pigs should be housed with a friend but if you don't keep two females together, you'll want to get your pigs spayed and neutered. Breeding can occur naturally, but birthing baby guinea pigs can cause problems for the females, especially if they don't give birth for the first time while they are still young themselves. Breeding a female guinea pig after they are six months of age is very risky.%&07%%&07%","rodents, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rodents.png?alt=media&token=dc6fe76f-764b-4c31-96f0-789b741c2818
Common Guinea Pig Behaviors,The Spruce Pets,"Guinea noises can mean lots of different things—it's how these little creatures communicate. By using sounds and postures just like capybaras, guinea pigs can actually say a lot. Though you may not understand all the noises they sometimes make, there are things they do that have a clear meaning and that can help you understand your guinea pigs. Read their body language and interpret their sounds—the chitters, squeaks, and purrs—to know what they're saying.%&07%Interpreting Your Guinea Pig's Sounds and Body Language%&07%%&07%Guinea Pig Sounds%&07%Guinea pigs make a variety of sounds or vocalizations, some of which most owners will recognize. Contented guinea pigs just going about their day often make a variety of squeaks, chortles, and quiet grunts that also seem to accompany casual interactions. Along with these frequent squeaks and chortles, there are a variety of other quite distinctive noises you might hear from your guinea pig. Learn to recognize these! %&07%•	Wheeking: This is a distinctive (and common) vocalization made by guinea pigs and it is most often used to communicate anticipation or excitement, particularly about being fed. It sounds like a long and loud squeal or whistle and sometimes wheeking may simply serve as a call for attention. Many guinea pigs will make a very loud wheeking noise in anticipation of getting some tasty treats when their owners open the fridge or get out the food container.%&07%•	Purring: Purrs have different meanings, depending on the pitch of the sound and the accompanying body language. Guinea pigs that feel contented and comfortable will make a deep purring sound, accompanied by a relaxed, calm posture. However, if the purr is higher pitched, especially towards the end of the purr, this is more likely a sound of annoyance. In fact, a guinea pig making this noise will be tense and may seem to even vibrate. A short purr, sometimes described as a ""durr,"" may indicate fear or uncertainty, usually accompanied by the guinea pig remaining motionless.%&07%•	Rumbling: A guinea pig rumble is deeper than a purring noise. It is made when a male romances a female and sometimes females in season also make it. Often accompanied by a sort of ""mating dance,"" rumbling is also sometimes called ""motorboating"" or ""rumble strutting"".%&07%•	Teeth Chattering: This is an aggressive vocalization that is a sign of an agitated or angry guinea pig. Teeth chattering is often accompanied by the guinea pig showing its teeth, which looks like a yawn, and it means ""back off"" or ""stay away.""%&07%•	Hissing: Like teeth chattering, this is a sign of a guinea pig who's upset. It is just like the hissing noise that a cat makes.%&07%•	Cooing: Cooing communicates reassurance in guinea pigs. It is a sound most often, but not exclusively, made by mother guinea pigs to their young.%&07%•	Shrieking: A piercing, high-pitched squeak called a shriek is an unmistakable call of alarm, fear, or pain from a guinea pig. If you hear this sound, it would be good to check on your guinea pigs to make sure everything is OK and none of them is hurt.%&07%•	Whining: A whining or moaning type of squeak can communicate annoyance or dislike for something you or another guinea pig is doing.%&07%•	Chirping: This sounds just like a bird chirping and is perhaps the least understood (or heard) noise that guinea pigs make. A chirping guinea pig may also appear to be in a trancelike state. The meaning of this ""song"" is the subject of much discussion, with no firm conclusions.%&07%Guinea Pig Body Language %&07%Guinea pigs can also communicate via body language. It's a good idea to get to know what's normal for your guinea pigs so that you can spot changes in their movements and posture, which can act as clues about what is happening with them. Understand what your pet means by these:%&07%•	Popcorning: Easy to recognize, popcorning consists of hopping straight up in the air, sometimes repeatedly, just like popcorn does while it is popping. It is most often seen in young guinea pigs who are especially happy, excited, or just feeling playful. Older pigs also popcorn, though they usually don't jump as high as younger pigs.%&07%•	Freezing: A guinea pig that is startled or uncertain about something in its environment will stand motionless.%&07%•	Sniffing: Sniffing is a way to check out what is going on around them and to get to know others. Guinea pigs particularly like to sniff each other around the nose, chin, ears, and back end.%&07%•	Touching Noses: This is a friendly greeting between guinea pigs.%&07%•	Aggressive Actions: These can include raising their heads and/or rising up on their hind ends with stiff legs, shuffling side to side on stiff legs, fluffing out their fur, and showing their teeth (yawning). These actions are often accompanied by hissing and/or teeth chattering. If your guinea pigs do this with each other, be on high alert for fighting.%&07%•	Strutting: Moving side to side on stiff legs can be a sign of aggression, often accompanied by teeth chattering. Strutting around another guinea pig while rumbling is a typical mating dance and the origin of the term ""rumble strutting.""%&07%•	Scent Marking: Guinea pigs will rub their chins, cheeks, and hind ends on items they wish to mark as theirs. They may also urinate on things or other guinea pigs to show their dominance.%&07%•	Mounting: This can be either sexual behavior (males to females) or behavior used to show dominance within the guinea pig herd's social structure, especially between females.%&07%•	Fidgeting While Being Held: This can often be a sign that your guinea pig needs to go to the bathroom or that your guinea pig is just tired of being held. Either way, try returning your guinea pig to its cage for a bit.%&07%•	Tossing Head in the Air: A guinea pig getting annoyed with being petted will toss its head back as a way of asking you to stop.%&07%•	Licking: Most owners consider this a sign of guinea pig affection, though it is possible that they just like the taste of the salt on your skin.%&07%•	Running Away From Being Picked Up: Guinea pigs tend to be timid, especially at first. Running away from you is not a rejection but rather a natural defense mechanism. Given time and patience, almost all guinea pigs will come to accept being picked up for cuddles and playtime outside of the cage.%&07%","rodents, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rodents.png?alt=media&token=dc6fe76f-764b-4c31-96f0-789b741c2818
Common Guinea Pig Diseases,The Spruce Pets,"Guinea pigs make great pets. While they are usually healthy animals, there are several diseases that commonly affect pet guinea pigs. By knowing what the most common illnesses are, you can be better prepared to monitor for signs and symptoms that your guinea pig may be getting sick.%&07%Signs and Symptoms of Common Guinea Pig Ailments%&07%All guinea pigs are different and even the five most common health ailments can present differently in different animals. It is important to note any change in behavior, appetite, elimination (urination and defecation), or other daily habits. Be aware of physical changes such as hair loss, skin redness, or swelling. Monitor any changes and speak with your veterinarian if you suspect there might be something off with your pet guinea pig. %&07%Ileus%&07%Guinea pigs should always be eating and defecating. If you see your guinea pig hasn't touched its food and you are seeing fewer and smaller stools being passed, your guinea pig may have ileus.1 Ileus is caused when gas builds up in the gastrointestinal tract (stomach and intestines). Due to the lack of normal peristalsis and no food coming into the digestive system, gas is unable to leave the body. This causes discomfort and can be life-threatening. Your guinea pig should receive immediate medical attention if you suspect ileus, so it can get a diagnosis and be prescribed the proper medications.%&07%Ileus can be caused secondarily by an underlying illness or stressor which, in turn, causes your guinea pig to stop eating. Monitor food intake and be aware of how any changes may have impacted your pet.%&07%Ectoparasites%&07%If your guinea pig has hair loss and is itching or scratching a lot, it may have lice or mites.2 The thought of having these things in your house—much less on the guinea pig—may make you itch all over. Lice or mites can be easy to avoid and treat. Lice and Demodex mange mites are conditions that can both cause itching and hair loss.2 Lice and their eggs are usually seen in the bald patches behind your guinea pig's ears and the mites can be seen microscopically all over the body. Speak with your veterinarian if you suspect any of these parasites to determine the best course of action.%&07%Guinea pigs can give these parasites to each other and can also get them from toys and bedding.2 Be aware before introducing any new guinea pigs if they seem to have any skin conditions. Before introducing food or bedding into the cage, make a habit of freezing it for a day. The extreme cold temperatures will kill off any potential parasites that may have been lurking in the packages.%&07%Uterine and Ovarian Diseases%&07%Spaying your female guinea pig is recommended. If she is living with a male, this will ensure population control and prevent multiple litters of guinea pigs. Besides preventing babies, females often develop uterine and ovarian issues, including various cancers, and having your female spayed can prevent these issues. Sometimes the uterus and ovaries can be removed even after the problem has been discovered but other times cancer has already spread to other parts of the body, rendering it untreatable. A complete ovariohysterectomy can be performed by your exotics vet on your guinea pig to prevent uterine and ovarian diseases, just as it would in a dog or cat. While some guinea pig owners are not able to justify the cost of the procedure, others see the great benefit of having their guinea pigs longer and not having to pay for emergency treatment when they notice their pig is sick.%&07%Respiratory Diseases%&07%Guinea pigs are sensitive to cold air drafts and can easily develop an upper respiratory infection or even pneumonia if you have a baby guinea pig. They can even get Bordetella bronchiseptica from your dog, cat, or pet rabbit.3 Take notice of your guinea pigs cage location and be sure to keep them away from drafts, open doors, and open windows. This simple act will help decrease the likelihood of them getting a respiratory infection. Wash your hands after handling other animals, including guinea pigs at pet stores, your dog or cat if they are coughing or sneezing, and even your rabbit. If you or your family are feeling ill, it's best to keep your germs to yourself.%&07%Uroliths%&07%More commonly referred to as bladder stones, uroliths often form in the bladder of pet guinea pigs. They cause pain and discomfort in your pet, and you may also notice that their urine is often bloody due to the irritation the stone causes.4 If you notice infrequent urination or bloody urine, call your veterinarian right away and they will do some tests to determine the cause. Bladder stones are often found on radiographs being taken for a diagnosis of ileus and must be surgically removed.%&07%Disease Prevention%&07%Guinea pig ailments can be hard to diagnose. The best way to keep your guinea pig healthy is to keep a close watch on your pet. Make sure it is eating and defecating, wash your hands before and after handling, freeze your pet's bedding and food before use, and keep it away from drafts. These actions will help you prevent the bulk of the most seen diseases, though there are, of course, numerous other diseases that affect guinea pigs. To rule out anything else or to look for internal issues, an annual physical examination with your exotics vet is always recommended.%&07%%&07%","rodents, diseases",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rodents.png?alt=media&token=dc6fe76f-764b-4c31-96f0-789b741c2818
General Care for Your Pet Hamster,The Spruce Pets,"Hamsters are common household pets. These small rodents usually live for about two years and do best if housed alone. There are different breeds of hamsters, and they range in size and characteristics. Know your breed and what its full-grown size will be so you can purchase the right sized cage and equipment. Hamsters are naturally nocturnal, so be prepared for some noises at night and position the cage in an area that works for you and your new pet.%&07%Before You Begin%&07%Before you buy any pet, make sure you have a home set up for it to minimize the stress of adjusting to a new home. Hamsters have a specific set of needs. They require exercise and mental stimulation, as well as a well-ventilated cage with a place to hide. Your hamster will also need a varied diet with a mix of store-bought food and fresh food. Make sure you know what your new pet can (and can't) eat.%&07%What You Need%&07%You'll need to provide your pet hamster with a few essential supplies, including:%&07%•	Cage%&07%•	Bedding and nesting material%&07%•	Food%&07%•	Food dish%&07%•	Water bottle%&07%•	Wheel%&07%•	House or hideout%&07%•	Toys%&07%Choose the Right Hamster Cage%&07%Get a cage that is large enough for your hamster, escape-proof, and easy to clean. While the modular cages with tubes are fun, they can be difficult to clean and are poor for ventilation (and the tubes can be too small for some Syrian hamsters). Never underestimate the ability of a hamster to escape, as it can fit through small spaces and chew through plastic walls surprisingly quickly.%&07%If you are getting a Syrian hamster, keep in mind that many cages marketed for hamsters will be on the small side. If you are getting a dwarf hamster, be aware that they can often squeeze through the bars of an average-sized hamster cage. You'll want to fully clean the hamster cage once a week. Safely remove the hamster and place it in a secure location while the cage is being cleaned.%&07%Add Hamster Bedding and Nesting Material%&07%Avoid cedar and pine-wood chips for bedding for your hamster; the odor can be irritating to hamsters' respiratory systems.2 Aspen is a safer option if you prefer to use wood bedding, but many people prefer to use paper or other fiber-based beddings. Hamsters love a cozy nest for napping. The cotton nesting materials found at pet stores is unnecessary and can cause problems if eaten or if it gets wrapped around their toes.2 Shredded toilet paper or facial tissues are excellent nesting materials and are economical as well. Bedding materials can be cleaned out and replaced during the weekly cage cleaning.%&07%Choose Hamster Food and Containers%&07%Pick a good quality food for your hamster. Pelleted foods offer a good nutritional balance and for many hamsters are a better option than loose food mixes. With a loose mix (seeds and other items), your hamster might pick out what it likes and leave what it doesn't, which could result in a dietary imbalance or an overweight hamster. A pelleted mix can be supplemented with a variety of other items, including fresh vegetables. Hamsters should be fed once a day. Remove any fresh food that has not been eaten within a few hours.%&07%A shallow, small but heavy bowl (anything that won't be easily tipped over) is ideal as a food dish for your hamster. A small ceramic or porcelain crock is a great option, as they are sturdy and won't be chewed up. You don't need to get fancy and buy a special hamster dish, but make sure whatever you choose won't be chewed up the next day.%&07%A small hanging water bottle with a stainless steel spout and ball is the most used water container for hamsters. A bowl is too likely to be spilled, dirtied, or filled with bedding. Make sure your hamster always has fresh water.%&07%Offer Exercise Options%&07%Hamsters love to run and need the exercise, so purchase the largest, best-quality exercise wheel you can. It should have a solid surface for running and ideally no cross supports (that might catch a leg or neck). Look for one that mounts on the side of the cage. Make sure the wheel is quiet as well since hamsters run at night. A small amount of vegetable oil dripped onto the wheel axis may aid in keeping the wheel quiet.%&07%In addition to a wheel, your hamster should have a variety of things to chew on and climb on. Hamsters need a lot of stimulation and exercise, or they can become bored. Bored hamsters start trying to chew through everything, with escape being the likely outcome. Plenty of hamster-safe items exist in the pet store, or you can use toilet paper tubes and tissue boxes to make toys for your hamster.%&07%Consider a Hamster House or Hide Box%&07%Your hamster will appreciate a private getaway for sleeping. A house or hide box can be as simple as a small cardboard box (it will have to be replaced often but is economical), a plastic hide box (it may be chewed up), a wooden box (it may be chewed or get soiled and smelly), or other things like a half coconut shell or a small clay plant pot. Upside-down plastic food storage containers such as a butter tub can be used if you cut out a door for your hamster (making sure there are no sharp edges).%&07%Preventing Problems With Your Hamster During Care%&07%Hamsters are hardy pets. The issue is that if something goes wrong, the hamster is so small, it will be affected quickly. Keep an eye out for an inactive hamster, not eating, diarrhea, hair loss, sneezing, or runny eyes. Some of these can be due to infections or even pneumonia.3 Try to keep your hamster warm and hydrated and speak to your vet about what to do.%&07%A hamster escape is another common issue. If your hamster escapes, keep watch near the cage and then spread your search out to other rooms. Since they are nocturnal creatures, keep watch at night and check under and behind furniture. If possible, leave the cage open with plenty of food so the hamster can return on its own.%&07%%&07%","rodents, general, shelter, nutrient, littering",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rodents.png?alt=media&token=dc6fe76f-764b-4c31-96f0-789b741c2818
Campbell's Dwarf Hamster,The Spruce Pets,"Campbell's dwarf hamsters are small, round-bodied hamsters with distinctly small ears and grayish-brown fur that has a dark stripe running down the back. They make fairly low-maintenance and affectionate pets, though they do need socializing or might be prone to nipping. They are also one of the fastest hamsters, sometimes making it difficult to keep hold of them. Still, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are relatively easy to care for, requiring a straightforward diet and regular enclosure cleaning.%&07%Species Overview%&07%COMMON NAME: Campbell's dwarf hamster%&07%SCIENTIFIC NAME: Phodopus campbelli%&07%ADULT SIZE: 5.08 to 10.16 cm long on average, weighing around 28 to 56 grams%&07%LIFESPAN: 2 to 3 years%&07%%&07%Campbell's Dwarf Hamster Behavior and Temperament%&07%Campbell's dwarf hamsters are generally low-maintenance, quiet pets. During their waking hours, they like to dig, tunnel, and explore. They are nocturnal but might be active for short times during the day too. Most are friendly and don't mind being handled, especially if you start gently handling them from a young age. But some might nip if they feel threatened. Plus, they can be a challenge to handle because they are so small and quick. %&07%These hamsters won't bond with a person like a cat or dog would, but many will come up to the side of their enclosure if you're nearby. And unlike some other hamster species, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are social with their species. They can be kept in same-sex pairs or small groups, ideally introduced to each other from a young age. But always monitor them for any signs of aggression, as they can become territorial. Also, because they are so small and fragile, it's best to keep them away from other household pets, including other hamster species.%&07%Size Information%&07%The Campbell's dwarf hamster only stretches around 2 to 4 inches long on average, and it generally weighs between 1 and 2 ounces. It will mature at around 2 months old.%&07%Housing%&07%Provide your hamster with as large of a cage as you can fit and afford, as this will be its primary spot to exercise and get mental stimulation. There are two main options for an enclosure: a glass/plastic aquarium with a secure mesh top for ventilation or a wire cage with a plastic base. If you go with a wire option, make sure the bars are close enough that the hamster can't squeeze through them, as these little creatures tend to be escape artists. %&07%Within the enclosure, include a nest or other structure in which your hamster can sleep and hide. Also, add chew toys and an exercise wheel with a flat surface (not wire) to prevent any injuries. %&07%You also can include hamster tubes and compartments for your pet to explore. But make sure they don't take up too much space, especially if you have multiple hamsters in the enclosure. Tight spaces can lead to a higher probability of territorial behaviors or fighting.%&07%Specific Substrate Needs%&07%The bottom of the enclosure should have a 1- to 2-inch layer of bedding, such as aspen wood shavings or unscented natural cellulose fibers. Avoid wire flooring, as it can damage tender hamster feet. Also, avoid cedar wood or pine shavings, as these can be harmful to rodents.1 Remove wet spots in the bedding daily. And fully change the bedding weekly when you wash the whole enclosure with mild soap and water.%&07%What Do Campbell's Dwarf Hamsters Eat & Drink?%&07%Hamsters should have constant access to food and water. A small ceramic food bowl works well, as it's too tough to chew and too heavy to knock over. Many owners prefer using a water bottle attached to the cage, as it helps to keep the water more sanitary. But also provide a water dish until you're sure your hamster is drinking from the bottle, and check the bottle regularly to make sure the nozzle is working. Fill it with fresh water daily.%&07%Select a commercial hamster food that's formulated for dwarf hamsters. Consult your veterinarian on the proper quantity to feed, as this can vary based on factors such as age and size. Discard any uneaten food after 24 hours. You also can give your hamster some supplemental foods, again consulting your vet on the appropriate types and amounts. Some options include oats, carrots, and greens. It's best to feed fresh foods in the evening as your hamster is waking up and hungry; remove them after a few hours to prevent spoilage.%&07%Common Health Problems%&07%Campbell's dwarf hamsters are prone to some health problems. Diabetes is common in the species. Symptoms include increased thirst and urination, as well as a sweet smell to the urine. Moreover, glaucoma is another common condition within this species.2%&07%Furthermore, hamsters are prone to wet tail, which is diarrhea brought on by an overgrowth of bacteria in the digestive system. It is highly contagious to other rodents and must be treated with antibiotics quickly or else it might kill the hamster.3%&07%Finally, hamster teeth naturally grow continuously. And sometimes they become overgrown, especially if the hamster doesn't have enough chewable materials in its environment to wear them down. Overgrown teeth can impede a hamster's ability to eat, and you might notice it losing weight. A vet can trim overgrown teeth and then advise you on how to prevent this problem.4%&07%Tip%&07%Not all veterinarians treat hamsters. So before even acquiring a Campbell's dwarf hamster, make sure there is a vet nearby who will see this animal.%&07%Training%&07%Hand-taming is the most common training people do with their pet hamsters. Always sit on the floor when handling your hamster, as even a drop from a few feet can seriously harm it. Also, make sure the space is secure in case your hamster accidentally gets loose. Never squeeze or jolt a hamster as you hold it. If it's getting antsy, place it back in its enclosure. It can be helpful to hold a favorite treat, so your hamster forms a positive association with handling.%&07%Exercise%&07%Exercise is critical for hamsters to help prevent health issues such as obesity. Providing a large enclosure and an exercise wheel should give the hamster what it needs to be physically active. You also can purchase a hamster ball for it to roll around outside of its enclosure. Ensure that the ball is the proper size for a dwarf hamster, and always monitor your pet when it’s in the ball.%&07%Grooming%&07%Hamsters self-groom and generally don't need any help from you. However, if they get some dirt or debris stuck in their fur, you can gently rub the area with a damp cloth if they allow it.%&07%Upkeep Costs%&07%On a monthly basis, food and bedding will be your essential costs for a hamster. Expect to spend it on your chosen diet and bedding type (plus the size of the enclosure). Every so often, you'll also have to replace chew sticks, nests, and other toys. Plus, make sure to budget for an annual veterinary checkup and emergency medical care.%&07%Pros & Cons of Keeping a Campbell’s Dwarf Hamster as a Pet%&07%Hamsters are interesting and generally quiet pets that don't take up a lot of space. They also don't require an excessive amount of maintenance. However, they are mostly up at night, so you might miss them when they're at their most active. And they can be difficult to handle as small, quick, and fragile animals. %&07%Reproduction/Breeding%&07%Local exotic veterinarians might be able to point you toward a good breeder or rescue to get your hamster. The main benefit of breeders is they often have a wider selection of younger animals, though their costs are often higher than rescues. If you buy one from a pet store, store owners might not accurately sex your pet. You also might inadvertently wind up with a pregnant female. To avoid accidentally becoming a breeder yourself, always keep hamsters solo or with members of the same sex.%&07%%&07%","rodents, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rodents.png?alt=media&token=dc6fe76f-764b-4c31-96f0-789b741c2818
Chinese Hamster,The Spruce Pets,"Chinese hamsters, also known as Chinese striped hamsters or Chinese dwarf hamsters, are small rodents native to deserts of China and Mongolia. They’re not technically dwarf hamsters, but they received that name due to their small size in comparison to other common pet hamsters, such as the Syrian hamster. They’re typically brown with a black stripe running down their back and a lighter belly. They also have a longer tail than most other hamsters. As pets, these hamsters are simple to care for. They are generally docile and easy to tame, though some can be a little skittish and nippy. Plus, their housing doesn’t take up much space, and their diet is easy to find in most pet stores.%&07%Species Overview%&07%COMMON NAME: Chinese hamster, Chinese striped hamster, Chinese dwarf hamster%&07%SCIENTIFIC NAME: Cricetus griseus%&07%ADULT SIZE: 7.62 to 12.7 cm long, weighing 28 to 56 grams%&07%LIFESPAN: 2 to 3 years%&07%%&07%Chinese Hamster Behavior and Temperament%&07%Chinese hamsters are nocturnal, meaning they sleep by day and are awake at night. But they sometimes might wake up during the day to eat and move around for a short time. Still, it’s best not to wake a sleeping hamster to handle it. That likely will make it grouchy, and it might try to bite you.%&07%As pets, these hamsters are generally good-natured and comfortable being held if you’ve consistently handled them from a young age. But if they’re not used to handling, some can be nervous and nippy. Moreover, because they are very small and quick, they can be difficult to handle. It’s best to sit on the floor when holding your hamster, as accidentally dropping it from even a few feet high can cause serious injury.%&07%Chinese hamsters won’t bond with people like a dog or cat would. But once they’re comfortable around you, they might come to the side of their enclosure if you’re nearby. Chinese hamsters can either be kept alone or in same-sex pairs or small groups. However, hamsters kept together might display territorial aggression toward one another.1 Your best bet to avoid aggression is to acquire littermates that can grow up together and become accustomed to each other’s presence. Avoid contact between your hamster and any other pets in the house, as they might injure this small, fragile rodent. %&07%They are generally low-maintenance, quiet pets, though they might keep you awake at night with their activity if you have their cage in your bedroom. Expect to spend a few hours each week on feedings and keeping the enclosure clean. Also, handle your pet and let it play in a small hamster exercise ball or other safe area outside of its enclosure for at least a few hours per day (likely in the evening once it’s awake).%&07%Size Information%&07%Chinese hamsters range between 3 and 5 inches long on average, weighing 1 to 2 ounces. They reach maturity at around 2 months old.%&07%Housing%&07%While these hamsters are tiny, they still need as large of an enclosure as you can fit and afford. This is typically their primary space for play and exercise, so having enough space is crucial for their health. At minimum, the cage should be 2 feet long, 1 foot wide, and 1 foot high. %&07%Cage options are generally either one with a plastic base and wire top or a glass or plastic aquarium. The wire cage will allow for better airflow, but you have to make sure the bar spacing is narrow enough that your hamster can’t squeeze through them.%&07%Include a nest or small animal hideout in the enclosure, which can be found at most pet stores. And add a hamster wheel with a solid surface for exercise. There also are all sorts of tubes, burrowing tunnels, and bridges that you can add to your hamster's habitat for enrichment. Moreover, make sure to include some wooden chew sticks or other chew toys made for hamsters, as this will help to wear down their continuously growing teeth. %&07%Clean the enclosure at least once a week, replacing all the bedding and washing the surfaces with mild soap and water. Hamsters tend to pick a corner of their enclosure as their bathroom. So it’s a good idea to scoop out and change the bedding in that corner every day to keep it sanitary. %&07%Specific Substrate Needs%&07%Place 1 to 2 inches of bedding, such as aspen shavings or paper-based products, in the bottom of the enclosure. Hamsters may be hypersensitive to certain bedding materials such as cedar chips. It is important to steer clear of this substrate as it can cause dry skin, alopecia and secondary bacterial infections in affected animals.%&07%What Do Chinese Hamsters Eat & Drink?%&07%In the wild, hamsters eat a varied diet of seeds, grains, nuts, vegetation, and insects. In captivity, you can feed your animal a commercial hamster food that’s supplemented with vitamins and minerals. Follow the package instructions for how much to feed each day. Most owners put a day’s worth of food in a small ceramic bowl in the enclosure. You can do this at any point during the day, as hamsters like to graze throughout the day and night rather than eat designated meals.%&07%Supplement the commercial hamster food with grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, and timothy hay. Put these foods in a separate dish from your hamster’s main diet. Supplemental foods should make up no more than 10% of the hamster’s overall diet. Some options include pieces of apple, carrot, and oats. It’s best to feed fresh foods only when your hamster is awake (often in the evening), so it can eat them before they start to spoil. Remove any fresh food from the enclosure within 24 hours, making sure to look for pieces of food that your hamster might have stashed in the bedding. %&07%Finally, hamsters always need access to clean water. It’s best to use a small animal water bottle attached to the side of the enclosure, which stays more sanitary than a water dish. But make sure your hamster is consistently drinking from the bottle before removing its water dish.%&07%Common Health Problems%&07%Hamsters are generally hardy animals, but they are prone to a few health problems.%&07%Wet tail is a common illness in rodents, especially hamsters. Formally known as proliferative ileitis or regional enteritis, wet tail is diarrhea that typically arises from stress or unsanitary living conditions, which bring on a bacterial infection. Besides having diarrhea, your hamster might be lethargic and lose its appetite.3 Seek veterinary care immediately, as wet tail can be fatal if it’s not treated. Plus, it can be contagious to any other hamsters in the enclosure. So if you do have other hamsters, put them in a separate cage and monitor them for symptoms. Thoroughly clean the primary enclosure, and don't reunite the hamsters until you're sure they're all symptom free.%&07%Hamsters also are prone to lung and airway disorders that can quickly become serious. Symptoms include wheezing, nasal discharge, sneezing, and lethargy. This condition also requires prompt veterinary treatment.%&07%Furthermore, when they don’t have adequate chew toys, some hamsters might experience overgrown teeth, which can interfere with their ability to eat. You might notice your hamster’s teeth look longer than normal, or you might just see it’s not eating and losing weight. A veterinarian can trim the teeth if necessary and then advise you on proper dental maintenance. %&07%Tip%&07%Prior to acquiring a hamster, it's important to find a vet nearby who can treat this animal.%&07%%&07%Training Your Chinese Hamster%&07%Hand-taming is typically the extent of training with hamsters. Start gently handling your hamster from a young age, taking care never to squeeze it or jostle it. If it's becoming stressed, put it down somewhere it's secure and comfortable. Any time it spends in your hands should be a positive experience. You can even hand-feed it treats as you hold it to help with the taming process.%&07%Exercise%&07%Providing an exercise wheel, along with a large enough enclosure, should be sufficient to keep your hamster physically fit and prevent obesity and other health issues. There are also exercise balls that you can put your hamster in to allow it to roam safely outside of its enclosure. Always monitor it when it's outside the enclosure.%&07%Grooming%&07%Hamsters are fairly clean animals that groom themselves. They don't need baths. But if your hamster does happen to get some dirt or debris stuck in its fur, you can take a damp cloth to gently help clean it.%&07%Upkeep Costs%&07%Your primary monthly costs for a Chinese hamster will be its diet and bedding. Expect to spend on your food and bedding choices. You also will have to periodically replace chew sticks, nests, and other toys. Moreover, make sure to budget for an annual vet wellness checkup, as well as emergency medical care.%&07%Pros & Cons of Keeping a Chinese Hamster as a Pet%&07%Chinese hamsters are low-maintenance pets that don't take up much space or make a lot of noise. They also can be quite fun and interesting to watch. But they are fragile animals that need careful handling. And they're nocturnal, so they might not be very active during your waking hours. %&07%Breeding/Reproduction%&07%A local exotic veterinarian might be able to point you in the direction of a good breeder. Make sure the seller doesn’t house male and female hamsters together, or you could end up going home with a pregnant female that you weren’t planning for. Observe the hamsters before selecting one. And note whether the seller keeps its animals’ enclosures clean. A dirty enclosure increases the chance of health issues.%&07%If the hamster is awake, it should be active and alert, exploring its enclosure. But if it’s daytime and the hamsters are sleeping, you still can look for signs of a healthy animal. Its fur should be clean and without any bald or ruffled areas. It shouldn't have any mucus on the face or wetness around the tail, which might indicate infection. Also, its breathing should be even and unlabored. If possible, ask the seller whether you can wake the hamster with a treat to make sure it moves normally. But expect it to be a little groggy.%&07%To avoid becoming an accidental breeder yourself, always house your hamsters individually or with members of the same sex.%&07%%&07%","rodents, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rodents.png?alt=media&token=dc6fe76f-764b-4c31-96f0-789b741c2818
Campbell's Dwarf Hamster,The Spruce Pets,"Campbell's dwarf hamsters are small, round-bodied hamsters with distinctly small ears and grayish-brown fur that has a dark stripe running down the back. They make fairly low-maintenance and affectionate pets, though they do need socializing or might be prone to nipping. They are also one of the fastest hamsters, sometimes making it difficult to keep hold of them. Still, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are relatively easy to care for, requiring a straightforward diet and regular enclosure cleaning.%&07%Species Overview%&07%COMMON NAME: Campbell's dwarf hamster%&07%SCIENTIFIC NAME: Phodopus campbelli%&07%ADULT SIZE: 5.08 to 10.16 cm long on average, weighing around 28 to 56 grams%&07%LIFESPAN: 2 to 3 years%&07%%&07%Campbell's Dwarf Hamster Behavior and Temperament%&07%Campbell's dwarf hamsters are generally low-maintenance, quiet pets. During their waking hours, they like to dig, tunnel, and explore. They are nocturnal but might be active for short times during the day too. Most are friendly and don't mind being handled, especially if you start gently handling them from a young age. But some might nip if they feel threatened. Plus, they can be a challenge to handle because they are so small and quick. %&07%These hamsters won't bond with a person like a cat or dog would, but many will come up to the side of their enclosure if you're nearby. And unlike some other hamster species, Campbell's dwarf hamsters are social with their species. They can be kept in same-sex pairs or small groups, ideally introduced to each other from a young age. But always monitor them for any signs of aggression, as they can become territorial. Also, because they are so small and fragile, it's best to keep them away from other household pets, including other hamster species.%&07%Size Information%&07%The Campbell's dwarf hamster only stretches around 2 to 4 inches long on average, and it generally weighs between 1 and 2 ounces. It will mature at around 2 months old.%&07%Housing%&07%Provide your hamster with as large of a cage as you can fit and afford, as this will be its primary spot to exercise and get mental stimulation. There are two main options for an enclosure: a glass/plastic aquarium with a secure mesh top for ventilation or a wire cage with a plastic base. If you go with a wire option, make sure the bars are close enough that the hamster can't squeeze through them, as these little creatures tend to be escape artists. %&07%Within the enclosure, include a nest or other structure in which your hamster can sleep and hide. Also, add chew toys and an exercise wheel with a flat surface (not wire) to prevent any injuries. %&07%You also can include hamster tubes and compartments for your pet to explore. But make sure they don't take up too much space, especially if you have multiple hamsters in the enclosure. Tight spaces can lead to a higher probability of territorial behaviors or fighting.%&07%Specific Substrate Needs%&07%The bottom of the enclosure should have a 1- to 2-inch layer of bedding, such as aspen wood shavings or unscented natural cellulose fibers. Avoid wire flooring, as it can damage tender hamster feet. Also, avoid cedar wood or pine shavings, as these can be harmful to rodents.1 Remove wet spots in the bedding daily. And fully change the bedding weekly when you wash the whole enclosure with mild soap and water.%&07%What Do Campbell's Dwarf Hamsters Eat & Drink?%&07%Hamsters should have constant access to food and water. A small ceramic food bowl works well, as it's too tough to chew and too heavy to knock over. Many owners prefer using a water bottle attached to the cage, as it helps to keep the water more sanitary. But also provide a water dish until you're sure your hamster is drinking from the bottle, and check the bottle regularly to make sure the nozzle is working. Fill it with fresh water daily.%&07%Select a commercial hamster food that's formulated for dwarf hamsters. Consult your veterinarian on the proper quantity to feed, as this can vary based on factors such as age and size. Discard any uneaten food after 24 hours. You also can give your hamster some supplemental foods, again consulting your vet on the appropriate types and amounts. Some options include oats, carrots, and greens. It's best to feed fresh foods in the evening as your hamster is waking up and hungry; remove them after a few hours to prevent spoilage.%&07%Common Health Problems%&07%Campbell's dwarf hamsters are prone to some health problems. Diabetes is common in the species. Symptoms include increased thirst and urination, as well as a sweet smell to the urine. Moreover, glaucoma is another common condition within this species.2%&07%Furthermore, hamsters are prone to wet tail, which is diarrhea brought on by an overgrowth of bacteria in the digestive system. It is highly contagious to other rodents and must be treated with antibiotics quickly or else it might kill the hamster.3%&07%Finally, hamster teeth naturally grow continuously. And sometimes they become overgrown, especially if the hamster doesn't have enough chewable materials in its environment to wear them down. Overgrown teeth can impede a hamster's ability to eat, and you might notice it losing weight. A vet can trim overgrown teeth and then advise you on how to prevent this problem.4%&07%Tip%&07%Not all veterinarians treat hamsters. So before even acquiring a Campbell's dwarf hamster, make sure there is a vet nearby who will see this animal.%&07%Training%&07%Hand-taming is the most common training people do with their pet hamsters. Always sit on the floor when handling your hamster, as even a drop from a few feet can seriously harm it. Also, make sure the space is secure in case your hamster accidentally gets loose. Never squeeze or jolt a hamster as you hold it. If it's getting antsy, place it back in its enclosure. It can be helpful to hold a favorite treat, so your hamster forms a positive association with handling.%&07%Exercise%&07%Exercise is critical for hamsters to help prevent health issues such as obesity. Providing a large enclosure and an exercise wheel should give the hamster what it needs to be physically active. You also can purchase a hamster ball for it to roll around outside of its enclosure. Ensure that the ball is the proper size for a dwarf hamster, and always monitor your pet when it’s in the ball.%&07%Grooming%&07%Hamsters self-groom and generally don't need any help from you. However, if they get some dirt or debris stuck in their fur, you can gently rub the area with a damp cloth if they allow it.%&07%Upkeep Costs%&07%On a monthly basis, food and bedding will be your essential costs for a hamster. Expect to spend it on your chosen diet and bedding type (plus the size of the enclosure). Every so often, you'll also have to replace chew sticks, nests, and other toys. Plus, make sure to budget for an annual veterinary checkup and emergency medical care.%&07%Pros & Cons of Keeping a Campbell’s Dwarf Hamster as a Pet%&07%Hamsters are interesting and generally quiet pets that don't take up a lot of space. They also don't require an excessive amount of maintenance. However, they are mostly up at night, so you might miss them when they're at their most active. And they can be difficult to handle as small, quick, and fragile animals. %&07%Reproduction/Breeding%&07%Local exotic veterinarians might be able to point you toward a good breeder or rescue to get your hamster. The main benefit of breeders is they often have a wider selection of younger animals, though their costs are often higher than rescues. If you buy one from a pet store, store owners might not accurately sex your pet. You also might inadvertently wind up with a pregnant female. To avoid accidentally becoming a breeder yourself, always keep hamsters solo or with members of the same sex.%&07%%&07%","rodents, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rodents.png?alt=media&token=dc6fe76f-764b-4c31-96f0-789b741c2818
Dwarf Hamster,The Spruce Pets,"Dwarf hamsters are several tiny species of hamsters that are native primarily to desert regions around the world. These social little creatures differ from their larger, more territorial cousins, thriving in pairs or small groups as opposed to living alone. As pets, they are generally docile and easy to handle, as well as fun to watch as they tunnel and romp around in their enclosure. They're also simple to care for, requiring a straightforward diet and regular cage cleaning.%&07%Species Overview%&07%COMMON NAMES: Dwarf hamster, Campbell hamster, Roborovski hamster, Syrian hamster, black bear hamster, Chinese hamster%&07%SCIENTIFIC NAMES: Phodopus campbelli, Phodopus roborovskii, Cricetulus griseus%&07%ADULT SIZE: Around 2 inches long on average; weighs roughly 1 to 2 ounces%&07%LIFESPAN: 3 years in captivity%&07%%&07%Dwarf Hamster Behavior and Temperament%&07%Dwarf hamsters comprise a number of species, and each has some specific personality traits. For instance, the Campbell hamster is a curious little creature that's notably easy to handle. The Robo (or Roborovski) hamster—a particularly tiny dwarf hamster that weighs in at just over 3/4 ounce—stays asleep during the day more than other species. And the Chinese hamster (not technically a dwarf species but just as small) is known for its love of tunneling, especially through its bedding. Overall, dwarf hamsters make for captivating and low-maintenance pets. They may not necessarily form a strong bond with their humans as a dog or cat would, but they will learn to recognize you and come to the side of their enclosure if you're nearby (especially if you have a treat).%&07%All hamsters are nocturnal, meaning they play and eat during the night and rest during the day, though some hamsters can adjust to their owners' sleeping and waking times. However, if you try to wake a sleeping hamster to handle it, the hamster might become grouchy and bite.1 In general, many hamsters will wake in the evening hours and happily interact with their humans then. Moreover, while hamsters make very soft and minimal vocalizations themselves, their movement during the nighttime can be an issue if you're trying to sleep. If you're a light sleeper, you probably shouldn't keep your hamster enclosure in your bedroom.%&07%Most dwarf hamsters take well to people holding them, but they will nip if they feel uncomfortable.1 They don't necessarily need other hamster companions, but keeping them in same-sex pairs or small groups can help to make them feel more comfortable. They generally should be kept away from other pets, including other species of hamsters.%&07%Size Information%&07%Dwarf hamsters slightly range in size, depending on the species. On average, they reach around 2 inches long and weigh 1 to 2 ounces. They'll generally reach maturity at around 2 months old.%&07%Housing%&07%A dwarf hamster's habitat should be as large as possible, allowing for maximum exercise and play. A cage that's roughly a 2-foot square with a height of around a foot is the bare minimum that some animal groups recommend. Habitat options generally include a glass or plastic aquarium with a secure top that has ventilation or a cage that's wire with a plastic base. Wire cages allow for better airflow to prevent overheating, though they don't protect as well as plastic or glass do against drafts. You must make sure that the wire spacing is close enough that your hamster can't squeeze through the bars.%&07%Include an exercise wheel in the enclosure that has a solid surface, not bars, for your hamster to run on. Also, provide plenty of wooden chew sticks or mineral chews in the enclosure. Chewing maintains a hamster's incisor teeth, which grow continuously. Plus, add a small nest or sleeping hut (available at most pet shops) for your hamster to rest and hide in when it wants to feel secure.%&07%Hamsters acclimate well to average household temperatures. Just be cautious of extreme temperature changes, and keep the habitat away from direct sunlight and drafts.%&07%Specific Substrate Needs%&07%On the bottom of the cage, there should be a 1- to 2-inch layer of bedding, such as chemical- and dye-free shredded paper or hardwood shavings. Change the bedding once a week when you clean all surfaces in the enclosure with soap and water, and remove wet spots daily.%&07%What Do Dwarf Hamsters Eat & Drink?%&07%A bowl of food and a small dish or bottle of fresh water should always be available to your pet dwarf hamster. Consult your veterinarian on the proper quantity to feed. In general, you should feed your hamster once per day, ideally in the evening when it's waking up and becoming active. Discard any uneaten food after 24 hours.%&07%Look for a commercial hamster food blend that's specifically formulated for dwarf hamsters. This will provide your hamster with all the vitamins and minerals it needs. You can also offer limited amounts of certain seeds, grains, fruits, and vegetables, including oats, carrots, and greens. Supplemental food should only make up around 10% of your hamster's overall daily diet.%&07%Keep sugary and high-fat foods to a minimum, and avoid toxic foods including macadamia nuts, avocados, and chocolate.%&07%Common Health Problems%&07%Dwarf hamsters are prone to a variety of health problems. Hair loss and skin lesions can result from several different issues. The most common culprits include the animal rubbing on something in the enclosure or being attacked by a cage mate. Any skin abnormalities should be checked as soon as possible by a vet, as they can quickly become infected.%&07%Hamsters also are prone to digestive upset, which usually goes along with some type of infection of the digestive tract. Wet tail, a bacterial infection that causes diarrhea, sometimes results from stressful or unsanitary living conditions.1 Hamsters with wet tail should be treated immediately by a vet, as this condition can lead to death as early as 24 hours after symptoms.%&07%Some dwarf hamsters, especially Campbell's hamsters and Chinese hamsters, are prone to diabetes.3 However, this often can be prevented by keeping your pet's diet low in sugar and providing plenty of opportunities for exercise.%&07%While yellow teeth are normal on a hamster, sometimes its teeth can become overgrown, especially if it doesn't have enough chewable materials to wear them down. Overgrown teeth can affect a hamster's ability to eat, so they will likely have to be trimmed by a vet.4 The vet can then make sure you're doing everything possible to keep the teeth at a normal length.%&07%Tip%&07%Before acquiring a dwarf hamster, make sure there's a veterinarian near you who will treat it. Not all vets have experience with this animal.%&07%%&07%Training Your Dwarf Hamster%&07%Calm, gentle handling from a young age can help a hamster feel safe when held. It's best to sit on the ground in a secure space (such as a small bedroom with the door shut) when holding your hamster, as these animals can move quite quickly and might break free of your hold if you're not paying attention. You don't ever want your hamster to drop from a great height—even a couple feet are a lot for them—as this can severely injure the little animal. It's also important never to squeeze your hamster in your hands, as this can result in injury for the animal or cause it to bite you.%&07%Exercise%&07%Providing an exercise wheel and a large enough enclosure should give the hamster what it needs to stay fit and prevent obesity and other health issues. There also are exercise balls for the hamster to roam around outside of its enclosure.

Syrian Hamster,The Spruce Pets,"Syrian Hamster%&07%The Syrian hamster, also known as the golden hamster, is among the most popular choices for small pets. It's generally easy to tame, fun to watch, and fairly low-maintenance, making it a good pet for beginners. These hamsters come from arid regions of northern Syria and southern Turkey. Most are golden brown with a lighter belly. But selective breeding has given rise to several variations in color, pattern, and hair length. Thanks to their popularity as pets, diets specially formulated for Syrian hamsters can be found in most pet stores. Plus, their housing doesn't take up that much space and is pretty simple to set up and maintain.%&07%Species Overview%&07%COMMON NAMES: Syrian hamster, golden hamster%&07%SCIENTIFIC NAME: Mesocricetus auratus%&07%ADULT SIZE: 5 to 9 inches long, weighing roughly 5 ounces%&07%LIFESPAN: 2 to 4 years%&07%%&07%Syrian Hamster Behavior and Temperament%&07%Syrian hamsters sleep during the day and are active at night. And while they are generally quiet pets, their nighttime activity might keep you awake if you have their enclosure in your bedroom.%&07%Certain hamsters can somewhat adapt to their humans’ schedule, but you should never try to pick up a sleeping hamster. Some hamsters might bite when startled or handled improperly.1 Thus, the early morning or evening hours are a good time to interact with your hamster. And if you don't squeeze or jostle your hamster as you hold it, it should learn to be content with people handling it.%&07%These hamsters are one of the most solitary animals in the wild, making them equally territorial. That means they should always be housed alone as pets. Sometimes young hamsters tolerate cage mates for a little while. But as they mature, there's a good chance they'll become aggressive, even fighting to the death. It's also best to keep any other household pets away from your hamster, as they could hurt each other.%&07%As pets, Syrian hamsters don't necessarily form a close bond with their owners. But they often will come up to the side of their enclosure if you're there, and many will enjoy lounging in your hands or on your shoulder.

The wire cages allow for better airflow, though they offer less protection against drafts.%&07%In the enclosure, include plenty of hamster toys for enrichment. An exercise wheel that has a solid surface (not bars) is ideal, as this minimizes the risk of injuries. Other options include tunnels and bridges for hiding and climbing, as well as wooden chew blocks for dental hygiene. Also, add a nest or sleeping hut (pet shops typically have several options) in a corner of the enclosure.%&07%Specific Substrate Needs%&07%Line the bottom of the enclosure with a couple of inches of bedding.

And change all the bedding weekly as you scrub down the entire enclosure with soap and water.%&07% Choosing the Best Cage for Your Syrian Hamster%&07%What Do Syrian Hamsters Eat & Drink?%&07%Feed your Syrian hamster a diet of nuts, grains, and seeds (typically what's in the commercial food blends) supplemented with fruits and vegetables, such as apples, broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, and pears. And because Syrian hamsters are omnivores (they eat plants and animals), offer the occasional hardboiled egg or feeder insect for an extra protein shot. If you use a commercial food blend, the supplemental foods generally shouldn't make up more than 10 percent of the hamster's overall diet. But consult your veterinarian for the best quantity and variety to feed, as this can vary based on age and size.%&07%Always keep a bowl of dry food in the enclosure and discard uneaten food after 24 hours. Hamsters typically like to graze, storing food in their cheek pouches and stashing it somewhere for later. Your hamster might even wake up a few times a day to eat and then go back to sleep. Whenever you're feeding fresh foods, it's often best to offer them in a separate dish in the evening when your hamster is waking up from its slumber and ready to eat. Remove uneaten fresh food after a few hours, so it doesn't spoil.%&07%Moreover, always provide a clean source of water for your hamster that you refresh daily. Many people prefer to use water bottles because they are easy to keep sanitary. But you also can use a shallow dish for water until your hamster learns to drink from the bottle.%&07%Common Health Problems%&07%Syrian hamsters are generally hardy animals. However, there are a few health conditions to watch out for. Wet tail—a gastrointestinal infection usually associated with stress and bacteria proliferation—is one of the most common health issues affecting this hamster.3 Symptoms include lethargy, diarrhea, lack of appetite, and wetness around the tail area. If you suspect an infection, take your hamster to the vet immediately. This issue can have a fatal outcome if allowed to fester, but antibiotics can effectively treat it.%&07%Hamsters can also contract fur and ear mites, especially from unsanitary conditions. If your hamster has mites, you might notice itching and loss of fur in patches. If so, contact your vet as soon as possible for treatment.%&07%Furthermore, some hamsters can develop overgrown teeth that make eating difficult. You might notice your hamster's teeth look a little longer than normal and that it's losing weight. A vet can trim the teeth and then recommend ways to maintain the hamster's dental health, such as adding more chewable materials to the enclosure.%&07%Tip%&07%Not all veterinarians have experience treating hamsters. So before acquiring one as a pet, make sure there is a vet nearby who will be able to see your hamster.%&07%%&07%Training Your Syrian Hamster%&07%Hand-taming is the primary training most people do with their hamsters. It's ideal to begin when the hamster is still young, so it learns to be comfortable around people. Sit on the floor in a secure space when handling your hamster, as even a drop from a few feet can harm it. It can help to hold a favorite treat to make the hamster's experience sitting in your hands more enjoyable. If it starts to get stressed, put it back in its enclosure.%&07%Exercise%&07%Between having a sufficiently large enclosure to roam about and an exercise wheel, your hamster should be able to remain fit. Exercise is important to prevent obesity and other health issues. You also can put your hamster in an exercise ball when it's out of the enclosure for it to roll safely around your floor. Always monitor your hamster when it's out of the enclosure.%&07%Grooming%&07%Hamsters are clean animals that self-groom. They do not need water for baths. If they do get some dirt or debris stuck in their fur, you can help them get it out by gently rubbing the area with a damp cloth.%&07%Upkeep Costs%&07%From month to month, your main costs for a hamster will be its food and bedding. Expect to spend depending on the type of bedding (plus the size of enclosure) and diet you choose. Beyond that, you'll occasionally have to replace chew blocks, nests, and other items in the enclosure. And you should budget for an annual veterinary checkup plus emergency medical costs.%&07%Pros & Cons of Keeping a Syrian Hamster as a Pet%&07%Syrian hamsters are generally low-maintenance, quiet, and interesting pets. They're fun to watch and can be tamed to hold. However, they are fragile small animals that need a gentle touch. And they are typically asleep for most of the day, so you might not get to see them at their most active.%&07%Reproduction/Breeding%&07%A local exotic veterinarian might be able to recommend a good breeder or rescue organization for hamsters. You'll likely be able to find younger animals via a breeder, though small animal-specific rescues often have good variety as well.%&07%When choosing a hamster, it's ideal to observe the seller's animals while they're awake. So ask the seller when the best time to visit with them would be. The seller also might be able to wake their hamsters for you to pick one by offering a desirable treat. A healthy hamster will be active and curious. Its fur should look clean, its droppings should be well-formed, and its eyes should be clear and bright. Red flags include labored breathing and a dirty bottom.%&07%If you'll be taking more than one hamster home, make sure to have separate housing for them ready. This will prevent fighting, as well as you accidentally becoming a breeder yourself.%&07%%&07%","rodents, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rodents.png?alt=media&token=dc6fe76f-764b-4c31-96f0-789b741c2818
Winter White Dwarf Hamster,The Spruce Pets,"Winter white dwarf hamsters, also known as Russian dwarf hamsters, are a small hamster species with a social personality. As pets, they usually are docile and take well to handle, though they can be difficult to hold due to their small size and quickness. They are around half the size of the Syrian hamster that is also commonly seen as a pet.%&07%The coat of winter white dwarf hamsters is a grayish-brown color for most of the year. But, in the winter, it changes to white to act as camouflage in the snow. In captivity, the coat isn’t guaranteed to change colors if the hamster isn’t exposed to the shorter winter light patterns. These hamsters are typically easy to care for as pets, requiring a straightforward diet and housing setup. %&07%Species Overview%&07%COMMON NAMES: Winter white dwarf hamster, Russian dwarf hamster, striped dwarf hamster, Siberian hamster%&07%SCIENTIFIC NAME: Phodopus sungorus%&07%ADULT SIZE: 3 to 4 inches long, weighing around 28 to 56 grams%&07%LIFESPAN: 1 to 3 years%&07%%&07%Winter White Dwarf Hamster Behavior and Temperament%&07%Winter white dwarf hamsters can make excellent and relatively low-maintenance pets, even for those who are new to hamster care. They are typically good-natured and are more tolerant of handling that several other hamster species, making them less likely to bite. However, they still might nip when startled, jostled, or squeezed. Plus, they might be too small and quick for some people, especially young children, to handle gently and safely. %&07%These hamsters are nocturnal, but they might be active for short times throughout the day. They are generally quiet pets, but their nighttime activities might keep some people awake if you have their enclosure near your bed. %&07%Moreover, they are a relatively social species that can be kept in same-sex pairs or small groups when introduced at a young age. However, adult hamsters that are new to each other might become territorial and fight. And even some young hamsters raised together might end up fighting and need to be separated as they get older. Furthermore, do not expose winter white dwarfs to other household pets, including other hamster species, as this can cause unnecessary stress and potential injuries. %&07%Size Information%&07%Winter white dwarf hamsters stretch around 3 to 4 inches long on average, and they weigh approximately 1 to 2 ounces. They mature at around 2 months old.%&07%Housing%&07%As a general rule, provide a habitat for your hamster that is as large as you can fit and afford. This will be your hamster’s primary space for exercise and mental stimulation. At minimum, opt for a cage that’s at least 2 feet long, 1 foot wide, and 1 foot high. The two main options for an enclosure are a glass/plastic aquarium with a secure top that has ventilation or a wire cage with a plastic base. Make sure the wire spacing is small enough that the hamster can’t squeeze through. %&07%In the enclosure, chew toys, an exercise wheel with a solid surface (not wires), and a nest in which your hamster can sleep and hide. You also can include tubes and other climbing structures, though make sure not to create a structure from which your hamster can take a significant fall.%&07%Specific Substrate Needs%&07%Cover the bottom of the enclosure with 2 to 3 inches of soft bedding, such as chemical- and dye-free shredded paper or aspen shavings. Avoid cedar and pine wood shavings, as they can be toxic to hamsters.1 Remove wet spots in the bedding daily and do a full bedding change weekly when you scrub the entire enclosure with mild soap and water.%&07%What Do Winter White Dwarf Hamsters Eat & Drink?%&07%For your pet's primary diet, pick a commercial hamster food that's specifically formulated for dwarf hamsters. Follow the label and your vet's instructions for how much to feed. Hamsters should always have some of this food available, as they tend to graze. Many owners put a full day’s worth of food in a small ceramic bowl in the enclosure and discard any uneaten food after 24 hours before refilling the bowl. %&07%You can also offer some supplemental foods, consulting with your vet on the appropriate types and amounts. Some options include greens, carrots, blueberries, and oats. Place fresh food in a separate dish from the staple diet and discard it after a few hours to prevent spoilage. It's best to feed in the evening as your hamster is waking up and hungry.%&07%Also, always provide your hamster with fresh, clean water. A water bottle that hangs on the side of the enclosure is best, as it's easy to keep sanitary. However, also include a small dish of water until you're sure your hamster is drinking from the bottle. Regularly check that the water nozzle is functioning and change the water daily.%&07%Common Health Problems%&07%Some common health problems in hamsters can include:%&07%•	Injuries from falling, fights with cage mates, or run-ins with sharp objects%&07%•	Respiratory infections%&07%•	Wet tail (diarrhea)%&07%•	Abscesses%&07%•	Skin issues (e.g., mites)2%&07%Some potential signs and symptoms of illness can include loss of appetite, lethargy, unwillingness to socialize (hiding), excessive scratching or hair loss, sneezing, wheezing, discharge from the nose or eyes, and abnormal droppings.2 If your hamster appears to be sick or injured, keep it in a warm, quiet spot and contact your veterinarian.%&07%Tip%&07%Not all veterinarians treat hamsters. So before even acquiring one as a pet, make sure there is an exotic vet nearby who will see it.%&07%%&07%Training%&07%Hand-taming is the primary training most owners do with their pet hamsters. And it’s important to note that some hamsters will never be comfortable with handling. It’s best to start handling hamsters when they’re young. Sit on the ground in a secure area when doing so, as even a drop from a few feet can injure such a tiny animal. Never shake or squeeze a hamster. Try holding a favorite treat as a reward for the hamster to sit in your hands. %&07%Exercise%&07%If you provide a large enough enclosure with an exercise wheel, your hamster should be able to get enough physical activity to keep it healthy and prevent issues like obesity. You also can give your hamster out-of-cage exercise via an exercise ball, in which they can safely roam around your floor in a secure area. Always monitor the hamster when it’s in the ball, and make sure you get a ball sized for a dwarf hamster. %&07%Grooming%&07%Hamsters are generally clean animals that are good for self-grooming. They don’t require baths or brushing. However, if they do get something stuck in their fur, you can help them get it out by gently rubbing the area with a damp cloth if they’ll allow it.%&07%Upkeep Costs%&07%From month to month, your primary costs for a winter white dwarf hamster will be its diet and bedding. Depending on the varieties you choose—plus how big your enclosure is and how many hamsters you have. Chew sticks, nests, and other toys also will need replacing periodically. Plus, make sure you budget for routine veterinary care and emergencies. %&07%Pros & Cons of Keeping a Winter White Dwarf Hamster as a Pet%&07%Winter white dwarf hamsters can be quite interesting and good-natured pets. They’re generally a good choice for people who haven’t had hamsters before. However, their small size and quickness can make them difficult to handle for some people. And because they’re nocturnal, you might not be able to interact with them when they’re at their most active. %&07%Reproduction/Breeding%&07%Local exotic veterinarians often can point you toward a good breeder or rescue group. Plus, many breeders belong to clubs that attend pet expos where you can learn about and even buy hamsters. Breeders often will have a wider selection of younger animals than a rescue group.%&07%Before bringing home a hamster, make sure it appears alert and in good body condition. Its environment should be clean, and any cage mates also should appear to be in good health. Avoid bringing home mixed-sex pairs or groups; they will turn your habitat into a breeding tank, which can produce a litter every three weeks. A good breeder or rescue will be able to confirm the sex of any hamster you're interested in.%&07%%&07%","rodents, general",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rodents.png?alt=media&token=dc6fe76f-764b-4c31-96f0-789b741c2818
Common Hamster Behaviors,The Spruce Pets,"The following hamster behaviors are completely normal so, if you see your pet doing any of these things, everything’s good in the hamster house.%&07%Being active at night%&07%If your hamster is awake and running around their habitat at night, have no fear – this is a sign of a happy hamster. “Hamsters are nocturnal animals,” says Dr Shermaine Wilson Cox , a small animal veterinarian based outside of Atlanta, Georgia, USA. “This means they are less active during the day and more active at night. They are really energetic and will exercise for three to four hours each night.”%&07%Chewing stuff%&07%Chewing behavior in hamsters is a way for these small animals to grind down their teeth. “Hamster teeth are constantly growing,” says Dr Sara Ochoa, a small animal veterinarian based in Texas. “Give them approved things to chew on. Things like wooden blocks or crunchy food are good for them to chew on.”%&07%Stuffing their cheeks%&07%Hamsters use their cheek pouches to carry and store food, says Dr Wilson Cox, who adds that hamsters can carry up to 50% of their body weight in their cheeks. “The cheek pouches are used to transport food, bedding material, and occasionally their young,” she says. “After stuffing their cheek pouches with food, they will take it back to their burrow or special hiding place and empty the pouches into their food store.”%&07%Burrowing and hiding%&07%Hamsters instinctively burrow or hide as a means of protection and staying safe. “This is their way of hiding from any danger,” says Dr Ochoa. “They will usually hide when they want to rest. This is how the stay safe while they sleep.”%&07%HOW CAN I TELL MY HAMSTER IS HAPPY?%&07%Watch your hamster closely and check out their body language. A yawning hamster is pleasantly sleepy and comfortable. Relaxed grooming, stretching, burrowing in the bedding, collecting food, and lively acrobatics in the cage are all signs that life is good for your hamster pal. Leaping into the air signals high spirits and reveals he or she is in a very good mood indeed.%&07%Hamster behaviors that are not normal%&07%The following are signs that a hamster may be unwell. If you notice any of these symptoms, make an appointment to see your vet as soon as possible.%&07%Hibernating%&07%If there is a sudden drop in temperature in a hamster’s environment, a hamster may go into hibernation – something that’s normal for wild hamsters, but not for pets. Dr Wilson Cox explains that this often happens at a temperature of around 41oF (5oC). A hamster’s habitat should be kept at normal household temperatures to maintain a healthy pet (up to 80oF (26oC).%&07%Lacking in energy%&07%Hamsters are active and energetic animals, so if your hamster is being sluggish, get them checked out by your vet promptly. “Any time a hamster is acting lethargic we start to worry,” says Dr Ochoa. “Hamsters do not show signs of sickness until they are very sick.”%&07%Not eating or drinking%&07%A healthy hamster should have a healthy appetite, so if your hamster is not eating or is refusing food, there may be something wrong. “With them being so small, even just a few hours without eating or drinking, they can get dehydrated very easily,” advises Dr Ochoa.%&07%%&07%Not chewing%&07%If you notice improperly aligned teeth or if your hamster’s teeth look overgrown and you don’t see them chewing regularly you should consult your vet immediately.%&07%Uncharacteristic hiding%&07%Hamsters do burrow and hide, but it’s mostly when they’re settling down for a nap. If your hamster is hiding constantly during regular awake or play periods, it may be a sign of anxiety or stress. “If a pet is afraid, they will usually be hiding a lot,” says Dr Ochoa. “They may do this if a cat (or other animal) is constantly watching them.”%&07%Other behaviors to look out for:%&07%Burrowing in bedding: This means your hamster is happily occupied and just digging around, quite possibly in search of a snack they buried earlier.%&07%Watching you with ears erect: This shows your pet is calm but rather curious about what’s going on%&07%Ears laid back with narrowed eyes: This is a sign of suspicion – they think something is up that they may need to run and hide from.%&07%Ears forward with cheek pouches puffed up and mouth open: Your hamster is showing that they’re scared about something – try to identify and remove what’s causing them stress – whether that’s loud noises or other pets getting too close to their enclosure.%&07%Standing on their hind legs with their front paws raised: Your hamster is telling you they’re feeling threatened and might get aggressive if you don’t back off – this may be accompanied by teeth chattering.%&07%Stretching their limbs: Your hamster is feeling pretty relaxed about life.%&07%","rodents, behavior issues",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rodents.png?alt=media&token=dc6fe76f-764b-4c31-96f0-789b741c2818
Common Hamster Diseases,The Spruce Pets,"Hamsters are hardy pets, but they are so small that when injuries and illnesses occur things can become serious quickly. It's helpful to know the most common signs of illness so you can jump on the problem as rapidly as possible. Often it's possible to address an illness or injury before it becomes life-threatening.%&07%Most Common Signs of Illness or Injury%&07%Hamsters typically show one or more of these signs if they are coping with illness or injury.1%&07%•	Loss of appetite%&07%•	Inactivity%&07%•	Huddling in a corner%&07%•	Ruffled or unkempt coat%&07%•	Sneezing, wheezing, and/or discharge from the nose or eyes%&07%•	Wetness around the tail%&07%•	Diarrhea%&07%•	Hair loss (often a sign of parasites or allergies)%&07%If a hamster is ill or injured, keep them warm and encourage them to take some food or water (by dropper if necessary) until a vet can be seen.%&07%Hamster Abscesses%&07%Abscesses are pockets of infection that can form from fairly minor breaks in the skin. Pus accumulates under the skin, sometimes forming a sizable lump that may sometimes begin draining on its own. Abscesses can form from cuts or scratches on the skin and also in the cheek pouches if abrasive food material causes scratches in the lining of the mouth. If a hamster continually looks like it has food packed in its cheek pouches, there may be an abscess or an impacted cheek pouch present.1 Abscesses require veterinary attention for draining, flushing, and treatment with antibiotics.%&07%Hamster Respiratory Infections%&07%Hamsters can get respiratory infections that can lead to pneumonia. Signs of a respiratory infection include sneezing, discharge from the eyes or nose, wheezing, and labored breathing.1 Occasional sneezing is not too worrisome, but if there is any loss of appetite, decreased activity, wheezing, or difficulties with breathing, immediate veterinary attention should be sought.%&07%WARNING%&07%Drafts and sudden temperature changes can put your hamster at risk for developing a respiratory infection and some types of bedding (such as cedar and pine) can irritate the respiratory tract leading to an infection as well.%&07%%&07%Wet Tail in Hamsters%&07%Also called proliferative ileitis, wet tail is a highly contagious disease and is most common in recently weaned hamsters. The cause is sometimes uncertain, but bacteria may be involved and in some cases, the disease is associated with stress, crowding, and dietary changes. Affected hamsters may die very quickly, exhibiting signs such as diarrhea (causing wetness around the tail), lethargy, loss of appetite, and a ruffled coat.3 Not all hamsters with diarrhea have wet tail, but if your hamster has any of these symptoms, you should seek veterinary care.%&07%Diarrhea in Hamsters%&07%Several infections can cause diarrhea including, but not limited to, wet tail, dietary changes, intestinal parasites, and treatment with antibiotics. Overfeeding vegetables and other fresh foods is a fairly common cause of diarrhea but, in this case, there is usually no loss of appetite or decrease in activity. Dehydration is a real concern anytime your hamster has diarrhea so make sure they are still drinking their water if it occurs.1 With diarrhea, withhold fresh foods for a few days and resume offering them only if the diarrhea is completely resolved. Then start back onto fresh foods slowly so that your hamster can slowly adjust to the dietary change. If lethargy or a lack of water intake occurs alongside diarrhea you should seek veterinary care.%&07%Skin Diseases in Hamsters%&07%Hamsters can be infested with a number of skin and fur mites that can be diagnosed from a skin scraping that your vet performs. Ringworm, a type of fungal infection, allergic dermatitis, and skin infections can also occur on the skin and require treatment by a vet.1%&07%Hair loss is not all that unusual and can be seasonal or happen in older hamsters. But if there is flakiness, redness, or any lesions on the skin, or the hamster appears to be scratching more than usual, a vet should be seen. Hamsters do have scent glands on their flanks which can be dark and sometimes alarm owners. These occur on both sides of the body and should not appear irritated or bother the hamster. Cedar bedding can also cause skin irritation so it should be avoided.%&07%Antibiotic Use in Hamsters%&07%Several antibiotics can cause fatal toxicity in hamsters due to how their gastrointestinal tract works.1%&07%WARNING%&07%Penicillin, amoxicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, dihydrostreptomycin, tetracyclines, lincomycin, erythromycin, vancomycin, cephalosporins, and gentamycin are all types of antibiotics that should be avoided in hamsters.1%&07%%&07%","rodents, diseases",https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/pet-support-website.appspot.com/o/default%20rodents.png?alt=media&token=dc6fe76f-764b-4c31-96f0-789b741c2818
